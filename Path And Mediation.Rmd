####First of all lets load all libraries we need in our model building 

```{r lib.,message=F,warning=F}
library(lavaan)
library(knitr)
library(semPlot)

```
####In this project i will work on the data which introduced in **Latent Variable Modeling Using R** Book chapter 2 

####This data to build the model which illustrated in This Picture  ![](D:\Data Science\STATS TUTORIAL & PRACTICE\statstools\SEM\Path.png)

#### The following is the covariance matrix which stated there , and I am going to convert it to matrix to use it in model building 

```{r cov,echo=FALSE}
cov<-c(
        84.85,			
        71.28,	140.34,		
        18.83,	âˆ’6.25,	72.92,	
        60.05,	84.54,	37.18,	139.48
        
)

#Convert it to Covariance Matrix

cov<-lav_matrix_lower2full(cov)

#Naming the matrix rows and columns 

rownames(cov)<-colnames(cov)<-c("TE","SC","MC","SA")

kable(cov,format = "markdown",align = "c")

```

####Now itis time to specifying the model using lavaan 

```{r model build}
model<-"
SA ~ b1*SC + b2*MC + c*TE
SC ~ a1*TE
MC ~ a2*TE
ind1:=a1*b1
ind2:=a2*b2
"
```

####After the specification lets run the model using cfa() function 

```{r model run,echo=FALSE}
fit<-cfa(model = model,sample.cov = cov,sample.nobs = 40)
fit.summary<-summary(fit,fit.measures=T,standardized=T)
```

####In the summary we can see that there is no heywood cases 
####Also after looking to fit measure we can find that CFI (0.949) is very good but we have a srious problem in TLI(0.695) and RMSEA (0.259) with cI (0.000 , 0.564)

####To diagnose the specify the problem correctly we have to have a look on the parameters to see the following :

##### 1- None significant loading (P > .05) between student acheivement and teacher expectation 
##### 2- Also we find that loading between matrial covered and teacher expectation is not significant (P>.05)
##### 3- Finally the mediation effect of Material covered is not significant (P > 0.05)

#### you can find the table & diagram of loadings and Mediation parameter bellow and also fit measures

```{r tables ,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
kable(data.frame(parameterestimates(fit))[-9,],format = "markdown",digits = 3)
kable(t(round(data.frame(fitmeasures(fit,fit.measures = c("chisq","df","cfi","tli","rmsea","rmsea.ci.upper","rmsea.ci.lower"))),3)),format = "markdown",row.names = F)

semPlot::semPaths(object = fit,whatLabels = "std",layout = "tree")
```

####Now I think that it is useful to run some modification on this model 

####So lets inspect the modification indecies first 

```{r mod inx,echo=FALSE}
kable(data.frame(modificationindices(object = fit,sort. = T)),format = "markdown",digits = 3)
```

####See here , the modification index dosen't add any usefull information , but we can conduct some modification by removing the none signficanat parameters (Note: It supposed to conduct modification on parameters one by one , but i modified it all in one step to save time)

```{r model 2,echo=FALSE}
model2<-"
SA ~ b1*SC + b2*MC 
SC ~ a1*TE
ind1:=a1*b1
"
#Run the model 

fit2<-cfa(model2,sample.cov = cov,sample.nobs = 40)

summary(fit2,fit.measures=T,standardized=T)

#drawing the diagram & tabels

kable(data.frame(parameterestimates(fit2))[-c(6,7,8),],format = "markdown",digits = 3)
kable(t(round(data.frame(fitmeasures(fit2,fit.measures = c("chisq","df","cfi","tli","rmsea","rmsea.ci.upper","rmsea.ci.lower"))),3)),format = "markdown",row.names = F)

semPaths(fit2,whatLabels = "std",layout = "tree")
```

#### Here we can see an improvement in CFI (.961) and RMSEA (0.159) although it stills bad 

#### also all parameters are significant So, lets test if the difference between the two model is significant using the difference in X^2 and CFI and RMSEA 

```{r diff,echo=FALSE}
anova(fit,fit2)
```

####The difference between the two model is not significant (P>.05) but we see a noticed improve in CFI(>.01) and TLI, so we will keep the most parsimonious and improved one (Fit2)
