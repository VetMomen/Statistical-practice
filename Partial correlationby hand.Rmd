## This Tutorial to explain how to do partial correlation using R and Matrix Algebra

Usually Partial correlation used to know the correlation between two variables adjusting of other set of variables, and to do it , you just need to know the following simple function :

![](/home/debian/Pictures/pcor.png)

and to know how to calculate the variables which subscripted by start , you need to make a residual marker matrix **M** as following : ![](/home/debian/Pictures/M0.png)

**I** here is an idetity matrix , and **X** is a matrix containing variables which you want to control for 

**NOW** let's get in ....

*You can find the data at : ****William H. Greene - Econometric Analysis, 7th Edition (2011, Prentice Hall)***


```{r}
library(ppcor)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

*ppcor* library is very usefull , i am going to use it to confirm my results 

Next i will load the data 

```{r load data}
dir<-"./data sets/APPLICATION AN INVESTMENT EQUATION.xlsx"


dat<-read_xlsx(dir)
names(dat)<-c("Investment","Constant","Trend","GNP","Interest","Inflation")


head(dat)

```

Now let's see the simple correlation 

```{r simple correlation}
cor(dat[,-2])

```

Here we see that the correlation between *investment* and *trend* -for example- is `0.7495873` but be carefull since this correlation may become misleading due to the realy existing relationship between both variables and others in the dataset 

So, i will use `ppcor` package to calculate the partial correlation 

```{r}

pcor(dat[,-2])$estimate

```

Here we can see that  the correlation between the same variables become `0.93600197` instead of `0.7495873` and it is also in the opposite direction !!

**Now** i will calculate the partial corelation by hand 

```{r}
#Firstly Forming a residual marker matrix 

i<-rep(1,nrow(dat))

I<-diag(1,nrow = nrow(dat),ncol = nrow(dat))

m0<-I-(i%*%solve(t(i)%*%i)%*%t(i))

#secondly , writing a function of pr2

pr2<-function(z,y){
        return(((t(z)%*%y)^2)/((t(z)%*%(z))*(t(y)%*%(y))))
}

```

in the next codes i will calculate partial correlation of :

1- Investment `~` Trend 
2- Investment `~` GNP
3- Investment `~` inflation
4- Investment `~` interest

```{r}
#Multiplying the centering matrix by each variable to get the variable star

datstar<-sapply(dat,function(x){
        m0%*%x
})%>%data.frame()


#use the oartial correlation function to get it 

pr<-matrix(NA,nrow = ncol(dat),ncol = ncol(dat))

for(i in 1:6){
        for(j in 1:6){
                pr[i,j]<-pr2(z = datstar[,i],y = datstar[,j])
        }
}

print(pr)
```
