# this project from [data.world](https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1/workspace/file?filename=avg-household-size.csv)
# and the aim of this data to use multivariate OLS method to pridect the death rate 

#First lets load our libraries 

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(caret)
library(car)
library(psych)


#download the data


#loading it 

data<-read.csv("./data sets/cancer.csv")

head(data)

#now lets look to the structure of the data 

str(data)

#here we have to note that the out come is count : count of death rate per year 
# so we have to use poisson regression instead of OLS regression 
#but for tutorial reason , I will use OLS instead of posson , then i will use poisson 

#Now lets look at the at the accuracy of the data , and if there any modification need to be acheived 

summary(data)
#some variables need inspection like;:
#avganncount
#avgdeathsperyear
#incidencerate
#studypercap
#popest2015
#medincome
#binnedinc
#medianage
#geography
#pctsomecol18_24
#pctbachdeg18_24
#pctemployed16_over
#pctprivatecoveragealone
#pctasian
#pctblack
#pctotherrace
#birthrate

#Most of these variables has issue with outlier ( which may also indicate skewness) and large number of missing data 

#So, lets first test the outlier percent and if we can impute it 
#the outlier per variables must not Exceed 5%

miss<-apply(data,2,function(x){
        round((sum(is.na(x))/length(x))*100,2)
})

miss

which(miss>.05)

#here we have issue with some variables which has a missing variables >.05 like:

#pctsomecol18_24 = 74.99%
#pctprivatecoveragealone = 20%

#here i have to Exclude these variables from out calculation 

data<-data%>%select(-which(miss>.05))

#summary again and outlier checking again 

apply(data,2,function(x){
        round((sum(is.na(x))/length(x))*100,2)
})


#great , and there is no need for any imputation 

# the next station is checking for outliers
#and the best way is to check for multivariate outlier using mahalanobis test

#choosing the numeric variables 

num<-data%>%select(-c(binnedinc,geography))


#getting the mahalanobis value 

mah<-mahalanobis(x = num,center = colMeans(num),cov = cov(num))

#Now calculating the cutoff points 

cutoff<-qchisq(p = .99,df = ncol(num))


#lets open the surprise box :P

summary(mah>cutoff)

#now we have 342 case which considered multivariate outlier 

#lets save it for later use 

outidx<-which(mah>cutoff)

#Now
