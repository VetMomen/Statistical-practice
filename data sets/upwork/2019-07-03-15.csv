The task is to determine movie release windows, e.g. Movie Blade Runner (1982) was originally released on 1982, 25th June (1st release window), then it had an extended cut release on 2002, 14th June (2nd release window), etc. We have a data of showtimes (country_id, movie_id, date, event_count). We need to add release_window to every date or NULL for pre-releases/ sparse screenings. Requirements: * A movie release is defined as any range of dates with one or more dates having more than 100 showtimes. * A movie release cut-off is any date with less than 5% of the maximum showtimes within that movie release. * Regardless of the number of count, dates with movie showtimes 30 days after the end of the last release window are ignored. In the sample dataset we see that it describes a single movie release. This movie release peaks on 2019-06-22 (5022 showtimes). We cut-off the showtimes that have less than 5% of the maximum showtimes within this movie release, i.e. we identify rows 3 to 17 (release_window=1), e.g. https://gist.github.com/gajus/49d3ae67ad4b221d38190eded4c000cf#file-result-csv-L3-L17. If there were more showtimes 30 days after this release window with any day having more than 100 showtimes, this would be the 2nd release window. The job is to write an SQL query that creates a materialized view that adds movie release window to every date of the showtime.

You can see how the data will be gathered in the attached spreadsheet. It is preferable, if you have some knowledge about SEO. The purpose of this correlations study is to find some correlations that should be used for understanding Amazon's algorithm. An example of a correlation that has been found, could be following: - The 1st organic search result has the keyword mentioned 10 times - Has in average 1k reviews - Has the keyword mentioned 10 times - The keyword is in always in the title of the 1st result - The average price for 1st result product is 20$ - and 1st and 3th quartiles Furthermore, please split up the correlation into general correlations (ex. number of words correlates positive/negative with number of pictures) and into specific based on the best ranking product. Example: #1st ranking product (keyword organic search number, 1) correlates positive/negative with Keyword in title. It may be difficult to know which correlations to look for, if you have no SEO experience or knowledge. If you have knowledge about SEO, you will also know that: ""The product that ranks 48th on a given search does not have the keyword in the title"" is relevant and ""Number of words correlates with the keyword's presence in the review section"" is not relevant. Another example of a relevant correlation: The worst ranking product has 1200 words in the description and the keyword mentioned 10 times, whereas the best ranking product only have 400 words and the keyword mentioned 2 times. I think the best results will in relevant cases be found by using smaller parts of the data set to find correlations. Example: Products from the keyword category - ""office supplies"": The correlation for amount of keywords in title and their ranking is positive/negative. Another thing, which I think we could be able to find: Keywords with 3 words in it has a correlation close to 1.00 with the keyword in the title. This is also something that is exciting to find.

Sometimes our scanning team misses areas, sometimes the data quality is bad. We want to know which areas we missed and which areas have we captured. I have a video explaining the process in full detail: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k5qvwzto43carz5/QGIS%20How%20to%20extract%20missing%20area%20maps.mov?dl=0 You will need the following tools for the operation: • QGIS with Spatialite and GeoTIFF support • Dropbox and a Dropbox account – we’ll be sharing files through Dropbox. For each building we will make available to you: • 6-band GeoTIFF files in which band 5 contains the captured point count the given floor that we will base our analysis on. • Spatialite databases that have been created from auto-converting CAD files. • A (logarithmic) color ramp configuration to apply as style for the GeoTIFF files. You will execute the following tasks (as explained in training videos) for each building (we will call it a “batch”): 1. You will create a QGIS project file You will execute the following tasks for each floor in the building: 2. You will create a layer group identifying the floor. As floor label you should use the same labels of the GeoTIFF file. The GeoTIFF files are named as follows: {Building-ID}_{Substructure-ID}_{Floor-Level-ID}.tiff 3. You will load the GeoTIFF file and assign the “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection in meters. You will apply the color ramp as a style as shown in the video. 4. You will load the Spatialite database and assign the “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator mm” projection (in millimeters). You will enable or disable vector layers until you got a good view. 5. You will create a new POLYGON layer in the Spatialite database (in “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection) called “missing” and mark up all areas missing (white) the the GeoTIFF file. Ignore crossed areas in the Spatialite layers and other areas explained to be excluded in the video. Each area gets a “label” field using the following naming scheme: {Building-ID} {Substruction-ID} L-{Floor-Level-ID} missing {running number} The running number is to be increased for each missing area marked up. The style should be backwards hashed and the label should be clearly visible on the map. 6. You will create a new POLYGON layer in the Spatialite database (in “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection) called “captured” and mark up the area that have been captured. Please be intelligent about it: You don’t need to create inner rings to markup holes and if the GeoTIFF ends close to Spatialite line vectors, use point snapping. The style should be forward hashed. 7. You will create a new “print layout” (paper format: A4 landscape) that displays the “missing areas” of this floor as shown in the video. Do not include the “captured” layer in the PDF. Each print layout should contain the following label on top of the page: {Building-ID} {Substructure-ID} L-{Floor-ID} You will save the print layout as PDF under the same name as the label above. The purpose of this PDF is: I want to give the map to my scanning team, so they know which areas they have to capture again. The missing area labels must be easily readable, so when I talk to them we can refer to specific areas by their label. Deliverables: • QGIS project file • “captured” and “missing” layers in each floor’s Spatialite database. • PDF file for each floor showing missing areas (like in the video). All deliverables will be shared through Dropbox or in rare cases through upwork file upload. We are hiring multiple freelancers for the job. We will be giving each one of you initially a small sample. The better the quality and the speed of your work, the more work we will assign to you from our backlog. In your application to this job, please specify: • How long have you worked with QGIS software? Do you have any question about what was shown in the video? • Have you worked with point-clouds before? How? What software were you using? Freelancers and agencies who do not answer the questions above in their application will be silently ignored. Please go through the training materials and share with me your questions. If you don’t have any question, I will assign you the first batch as a paid trial run. Please provide me with the following details to set up up for the job: • The email address for your Dropbox account. I will be sharing a folder with you for each registration job that you work on. • Which version of QGIS are you intending to use?

I am interested in looking at my City’s residential property market using Python/Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium, Plot.ly, SciKit-Learn, Seaborn, Random forests, scikit-learn and yelp fusion API in order to try to understand: - The distribution of sold prices of apartments and houses - Identify popular areas - Pin point locations where properties tend to be cheaper than average - Predict the prices of properties Here is an example of what I'm looking to do https://towardsdatascience.com/going-dutch-how-i-used-data-science-and-machine-learning-to-find-an-apartment-in-amsterdam-part-def30d6799e4 see https://github.com/rafaelpierre/going-dutch the pynb file etc. Also see https://towardsdatascience.com/going-dutch-part-2-improving-a-machine-learning-model-using-geographical-data-a8492b67b885. I have the data available, no scraping required. Requirements: - Data merge and clean up. See attached size and price paid spreadsheet. This is a record of properties that have sold, and their sizes along with some other information. Use attached 'open_postcode_geo' file to add long/lat coordinates to all records in 'price' sheet by matching postcodes. In 'size' sheet find all duplicate addresses, and keep the most recent versions based on INSPECTION_DATE' field. Disregard the older duplicates in 'size'. Now use fuzzy matching or any preferred method to merge the two sheets 'size' and 'price paid' based on address. The relevant fields for this are: ADDRESS1, ADDRESS2, ADDRESS3, POSTCODE, LOCAL_AUTHORITY_LABEL, in 'size' postcode, address1, address2, address3, address4, city, in 'price paid' The final result should be the 'price paid' sheet populated with the information from 'size' sheet. Once this is done, this 'size' sheet will not be required. - Create a Pandas DataFrame. Show some basic statistics e.g. quartiles, minimum, max and mean values for most of the variables. The key variables are 'total_floor_area', 'number_habitable_rooms' and 'price'. Convert date_time fields to integers, using unix epoch or similar. Snapshot data using plot.ly box plot. (see jupyter file in link above for how to do these). - Assist in interpreting the data: Deviation from normal distribution. Skewness and kurtosis. Seaborn pairplots to visually show relationships between variables. Seaborn heat maps to plot pearson correlation values between variables. Drop variables with negligible correlations. Zoom into variables with correlations, both log scale and non scaled. Price v latitude and size v latitude to locate good area for acquisitions. Folium visualization on map, open source mapping e.g. openstreetmap. - Analysis: Random forests. Try to predict 'price'. Training set composed of 70% of data set and test set of 30% of data set. R2 score to check prediction accuracy. - Proximity to amenities. Query yelp’s fusion API to get data on places of interest (POI’s) for ten amenities (e.g. groceries, cafe's etc). Calculate distance from those POI’s. Count number of POI’s within a certain radius. Box plots to see how these variables price. Heatmap pearson correlation matrix to identify significant linear relationships (if any). Train the model and see how it performs by running analysis step again.

We have a number of client dashboards that are updated either directly from the data source (Analytics, Ads) and we set most of that up. Many of our dashboards are more complex than that. These require us to get data into a G Sheet and then flows into a Data Studio Template. We use Supermetrics as the connector in G Sheets, where we bring in daily data from a number of sources, do some processing in G Sheets, and then offer it to our clients usually through Data Studio Templates. We have an immediate need to find an application data developer who is familiar with G Sheets, App Script, and Supermetrics (although that's pretty easy to learn). We'd also like to find someone who has Biq Query experience, and can eventually help us connect our G Sheets applications to Big Query tables, off loading some processing time (and big data). Right now we have several dashboards that are breaking ... aren't updating from Supermetrics ... which happens far too frequently (haha), but that's the way it goes. So, initially your work will be about fixing those problems as they arise.

I have a couple of browser extensions that I want to track installs (“Conversions/Goals”) for in Google Analytics. I have two browser extensions, which are on two different domains and then there’s a 3rd domain that is also involved that displays search results for one of the browser extensions. I think I need to simplify things and get rid of the 3rd domain, consolidating that into the same domain used by the one browser extension. I have Google Analytics setup, however it’s not setup properly and I am not an expert by any means. I have two extensions at the moment, but there will be more in the future with more domains, so I think I should be using Google Tag Manager, but you would tell me if hired. I need help. Things I want to track/know: - How many people click this big ‘continue’ button on my primary domain? How many try to exit my install process? - How many hit track_install? (which is a url that doesn’t exist on my domain, however the Google Chrome Store allows me to input my domain and will feed by Analytics when an install occurs in the Google Chrome Store of my extension) - How many hit /webstore/detail/… (which is again, another URL that Google Chrome Store will hit my analytics with so that I can track conversions/rates of how my Google Chrome Store description page is working for me -- thus, if I try different text or screenshots, it could affect my conversion rate) - How many people hit /success/ (prob same amount as track_install) [The /success/ page is called after the user installs extension1. We then call that same /success/ page after the user installs extension2. Both times we hit one of our domains for that url, the thinking is that tracking the conversions will be easier. If you work with me, I’d like your thoughts on this, as well as our other urls in order to ensure proper conversion tracking] - Setup a funnel for the 2-4 steps involved for the user to install both of my extensions (the How many people uninstall? (When they do uninstall either extension, we call an uninstall URL on both domains) - How many people hit my websites and I present an error page to them, because I do not support their browser? (My extensions are only for Firefox and Chrome desktop web browsers) - I have another subdomain on one of the domains, and then this 3rd domain, which both display search results to users. I’m thinking of removing the 3rd domain, and the subdomain on the other domain, and simply putting the search results at ‘/search/’ on both domains; I think this would simplify things, but wasn’t really thinking about that at the time we developed these. I’d like to discuss this with you if you’re hired. - How many searches happened today on each site? (I use Google Custom Search Engine -- CSE) I have not bought adwords ads yet, but I plan to do that and want everything ready to do that, so that I can know when certain adgroups/keywords are not converting for me (and vice-versa, which ones are working great and I should spend more).

We began pointing all of our paid traffic to generic ""all products"" pages, where in the past we used to point that traffic to highly optmized product pages. I want to see how conversion rate of paid traffic has changed, before and after that change. 2. We cancelled a referral softare system recently. I want to see how referral traffic has changed, and how much that accounted for for us 3. We raised prices back in January of this year. I want to see how that affected AOV and conversion rate 4.

We are also interested in where applications to certain lenders fall in a sequence, and whether that application was made in isolation, or as part of a cluster of applications. Background: Our service connects users with various lending options based on their profile. The average number of applications per user is approximately 1.6, which has a skewed distribution to a long tail that can stretch to 10 or more applications. A user will sometimes apply to several options in 1 single sessions, and sometimes can wait several months before applying again. We are trying to gain insights from the order and time differences in which the applications are made to ascertain if certain lending options should be presented at different times, or not at all. ‘Success’ for our business is measured in Transactions, ie: the application leads to an approval and there is commission earned. The magnitude of the commission is secondary to whether there is a commission at all. Data Fields: ApplicationID - integer string - unique for each application UserID - integer string - unique for each user StatusID - numerical code for status of the application, which is one of 6 possible codes. User Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the user joined the platform Application Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the application was created Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Week# - simple breakdown of Application Created Date into components LenderID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each lender PartnerID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each affiliate partner Credit Score ID - numerical indicator (from 1 to 5) denoting the user’s credit score band (eg: Fair, Good, Excellent etc.) Transaction Value - currency string - value of the commission arising from an application, if any. Transaction Date - when the transaction occurred App. Rec. - if the application was created during the month-end reconciliation process. Any row where this value = 1 has a Transaction Date that is earlier than the Application Date, and thus any analysis comparing those 2 fields should exclude these rows. less","Apache Hive, Knime, R, Python",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Canada",NA,NA,NA

Each unit is scored for quality. (Product score) This score ranges from 0.01 to 30. We then separate and package these products into the 5 different sorts (or grades) Each sort has a different market value. Sort 5 is the most valuable and Sort 1 the least valuable Some products are eligible to be placed in any of the 5 categories. Obviously, we would like the to separate the products so that the overall mix of sorts is the most valuable. However, as a population, each sort must satisfy two requirements. The Average Product Score for that product must meet a minimum criteria and the 5%ile score for that product must meet a minimum criteria. If you move a product from one category to another, it changes the average and 5%ile property for both categories. We know the distribution of the Product scores before we undertake the sorting process. (Think of it like a bucket of marbles and we know the Product score of each of the marbles before we sort them) We are looking for a programmer to write code that calculates the optimum sorting set-points for each of the sorts that maximizes the value whilst meeting the minimum value Average Product Score for each sort and the minimum value 5%ile Product Score for each sort.
