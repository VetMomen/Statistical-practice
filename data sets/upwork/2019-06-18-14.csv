I have a particular analytical method for research using digital analytics data, which I have used for many years. However I have always been aware that the statistical side of the method is not up to scratch - I would like a statistician to review this, recommend the correct method, and create a reusable formula (or process) which can work within Excel. I am aware I may not be using the correct statistical terminology here, but I think you will get the gist at this stage. The analysis is designed to identify the independent variables correlated to a dependent variable. For example, overall conversion might be a binary, dependent variable into which I can group sessions (0=visited the site and did not convert, 1=visited the site and did convert). Then, using segments in the analytics tool, I then pull data for every single dimension (the independent variables) in the data. So, for example, I will know that for first time visitors there are x sessions which = 1 and x sessions which = 0 - and so on. The objective of this is to uncover insights as to the predictive drivers of conversion, or of whatever binary factor I am investigating (It could also just be drop off from a specific page). For example, I might find that mobile device type = mobile has the strongest negative correlation. So, I want to know 2 things: 1) within a dimension/variable, how does each value compare to the average. This is a bit like imagining that each value is a variant in a test where the average is the control. How do you say that a comparison is significant or not? 2) agnostic of the values within the dimensions, which variable in itself is the most discriminate, a bit like if you were going to build a logistic regression model or something. This has to work in Excel formulas and, as such, it doesn't have to be perfect - but it needs to be better than the way I am doing it now, which I know is not the best. less",NA,NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA

The exact instructions (which I will provide upon hire) are also listyed at the bottom of this post. I will provide the website I am asking them to link to in the web-based interface. If the page is not valid (ie, it is not appropriate to ask for a link on the page to my website) - mark it as 'Not Valid.' I will pay you $1 for every email you find (I will be checking accuracy of the emails you submit). I just need you to try and find the right email. I will also pay $0.10 for every page you mark as 'Not Valid' since this task typically takes a small fraction of the time to determine if the page isn't valid. See attached screenshot of the web-based interface that I will provide to you. You will have a login and can do this work anytime you'd like. I keep track of statistics like how many emails you've completed per week so you know how much to bill me for. For example, if the URL I give you is this: https://www2.ewu.edu/cstem/departments/mathematics/math-degrees/careers-in-mathematics Then you would provide me the email 'mgrant@ewu.edu' (you can see it listed at the bottom-left of the page) because that is the faculty member who maintains it. You should NOT provide me a boilerplate webmaster email for wustl.edu. I want the specific email for the specific person that maintains that specific page or group of pages. I can afford to pay up to $500 per week ($2,000 per month) to start with, and can either increase or decrease volume based on the results of what you give me. EXACT INSTRUCTIONS: 2. Navigate (left click) to each url that you are presented with 3. If no email exists, the URL does not work, or the page is not in English, then click 'Not Valid' - otherwise, proceed to step 4. 4. Determine whether or not this page is appropriate to ask for a link to be placed on it to my site (you have this information in your main 'list' page). If it's not relevant to ask for a link on, then go back to the Sitedial window, and click 'Not Valid.' If the URL is relevant to ask for a link to be placed going back to my site, then proceed to step 5. 5. Visit the URL and click around the website if needed to find the email address of the person that would update and add a link to the specific webpage, or - if unavailable - the website's general webmaster. If neither of those is present, try and find a general contact email for the site, and if that is also not present, 6. You can also use site queries in Google to try and find the webmaster, such as ""site:example.com webmaster"" or “example.com contact” 7. When you find the email, record the email address into the textbox underneath the URL back on the Sitedial page (please note, we use email validation to determine is an email exists & is active, so if the email does not exist - you will be flagged to try another email) 5. If no email exists, and you cannot find it, simply leave the box blank click 'Not Found' Thank you! less","Link Building, SEO Backlinks, Data Entry,  ",NA,"$20k+ ","4.96 Stars, based on 39 feedbacks","United States",NA,4.96,39

The website will allow users to sign up and create their own interactive sporting league that will allow them and all their friends who join the league to input their statistics when they complete a round regarldess of where in the world they are. Each player can add their own scores and stats and then complete with others around the world in their league. Further details: The structure: Pages 1. Sign in/Sign up (this will be the homepage, so it's very simple) 2. Profile page (profile info, join and create a league). You will also be able to see all the leagues you are in. As you could be in multiple leagues. 3. League page. (something like this - http://alchemists-wp.dan-fisher.com/soccer/team/alchemists/) 4. Billing & payment page. 5. Page about player. What should be included on the league page? - A league table - Past Winners - Although this will be blank to begin with - Various Stats - any that we could include . E.g. player average score, best round, worst round. - Player Updates/Log - as someone enters a score it says ""John Deer has just scored 36 points at..."" (this on the right-hand side of the example page and I assume is built into the plugin) As we allow people to enter more stats we can increase the stats that are shown but to begin with I think that's all that's needed. Users must be able to easily add their scores and the leagues automatically updates. Personalisation of the league - Option to specify how many rounds for that league. This can be a fixed number of rounds each, or it can be time-based until a certain date where the best 10 scores are counted etc. Inclusion of Major Events - not essential but if we could do this would be great. The league organise can set certain dates as a ‘major’. One round you get an extra point for these rounds... adds a bit of pressure. Also if they have actual in person competitions - like a big tournament, I would like them to able to add the winner to the stats. It would also be good to be able to arrange these in person tournaments via the page. less","Website, WordPress, Web Apps, Wordpress Website",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA

The data will be extracted from finance.yahoo.com (under Historical Data when getting a stock quote). I will plot the efficient frontier for the pair of stocks and determine the minimum variance portfolio of the two, as will, this calculation going to be repeated for other four pairs of stocks (e.g., high correlation, low correlation, negative correlation, etc.). Then I will give a brief explanation for why the most highly correlated pair have such a correlation (e.g., related to their business activities), and similarly for the pair with the least correlation. Then, I'm going to explore an additional of risk-free assets, and what conclusion can be draw in relation to one of portfolios from what we discussed in classes. For the 10 stocks together using 2 years of daily data I am going to estimate the covariance and find sets of portfolio weights that maximize return, minimize risk, and maximize the Sharpe ratio. As will for the cases when short-selling is allowed and is not allowed and write a discussion of the results. The fundamental goal of portfolio theory is to optimally allocate the investments between different assets. Mean variance optimization (MVO) is a quantitative tool that will allow us to make this allocation by considering the trade-off between risk and return. In conventional single period (MVO), I will make the portfolio allocation for a single upcoming period, and the goal will be to maximize the expected return subject to a selected level of risk. Single period (MVO) was developed in the pioneering work of Markowitz. The single period Markowitz algorithm solves the following problem: Inputs: o The expected return for each asset o The standard deviation of each asset (a measure of risk) o The correlation matrix between these assets Output: o The efficient frontier, i.e. the set of portfolios with expected return greater than any other with the same or lesser risk, and lesser risk than any other with the same or greater return. The efficient frontier is conventionally plotted on a graph with the standard deviation (risk) on the horizontal axis, and the expected return on the vertical axis. The basic principles of balancing risk and return may already be appreciated in a two-asset portfolio. less","Mathematics, Presentations, Statistics, Financial Reports,  ",NA,"$400 ","4.99 Stars, based on 4 feedbacks","Canada",NA,4.99,4
