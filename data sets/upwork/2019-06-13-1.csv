If the page is not valid (ie, it is not appropriate to ask for a link on the page to my website) - mark it as 'Not Valid.' I will pay you $1 for every email you find (I will be checking accuracy of the emails you submit). I just need you to try and find the right email. I will also pay $0.10 for every page you mark as 'Not Valid' since this task typically takes a small fraction of the time to determine if the page isn't valid. See attached screenshot of the web-based interface that I will provide to you. You will have a login and can do this work anytime you'd like. I keep track of statistics like how many emails you've completed per week so you know how much to bill me for. For example, if the URL I give you is this: https://www2.ewu.edu/cstem/departments/mathematics/math-degrees/careers-in-mathematics Then you would provide me the email 'mgrant@ewu.edu' (you can see it listed at the bottom-left of the page) because that is the faculty member who maintains it.

Navigate (left click) to each url that you are presented with 3. If no email exists, the URL does not work, or the page is not in English, then click 'Not Valid' - otherwise, proceed to step 4. 4. Determine whether or not this page is appropriate to ask for a link to be placed on it to my site (you have this information in your main 'list' page). If it's not relevant to ask for a link on, then go back to the Sitedial window, and click 'Not Valid.' If the URL is relevant to ask for a link to be placed going back to my site, then proceed to step 5. 5. Visit the URL and click around the website if needed to find the email address of the person that would update and add a link to the specific webpage, or - if unavailable - the website's general webmaster. If neither of those is present, try and find a general contact email for the site, and if that is also not present, 6. You can also use site queries in Google to try and find the webmaster, such as ""site:example.com webmaster"" or “example.com contact” 7. When you find the email, record the email address into the textbox underneath the URL back on the Sitedial page (please note, we use email validation to determine is an email exists & is active, so if the email does not exist - you will be flagged to try another email) 5.

The website will allow users to sign up and create their own interactive sporting league that will allow them and all their friends who join the league to input their statistics when they complete a round regarldess of where in the world they are. Each player can add their own scores and stats and then complete with others around the world in their league. Further details: The structure: Pages 1. Sign in/Sign up (this will be the homepage, so it's very simple) 2. Profile page (profile info, join and create a league). You will also be able to see all the leagues you are in. As you could be in multiple leagues. 3. League page. (something like this - http://alchemists-wp.dan-fisher.com/soccer/team/alchemists/) 4. Billing & payment page. 5. Page about player. What should be included on the league page? - A league table - Past Winners - Although this will be blank to begin with - Various Stats - any that we could include . E.g. player average score, best round, worst round. - Player Updates/Log - as someone enters a score it says ""John Deer has just scored 36 points at..."" (this on the right-hand side of the example page and I assume is built into the plugin) As we allow people to enter more stats we can increase the stats that are shown but to begin with I think that's all that's needed. Users must be able to easily add their scores and the leagues automatically updates. Personalisation of the league - Option to specify how many rounds for that league. This can be a fixed number of rounds each, or it can be time-based until a certain date where the best 10 scores are counted etc. Inclusion of Major Events - not essential but if we could do this would be great. The league organise can set certain dates as a ‘major’. One round you get an extra point for these rounds... adds a bit of pressure. Also if they have actual in person competitions - like a big tournament, I would like them to able to add the winner to the stats. It would also be good to be able to arrange these in person tournaments via the page. less","Website, WordPress, Web Apps, Wordpress Website",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA

I have a couple of browser extensions that I want to track installs (“Conversions/Goals”) for in Google Analytics. I have two browser extensions, which are on two different domains and then there’s a 3rd domain that is also involved that displays search results for one of the browser extensions.

I have two extensions at the moment, but there will be more in the future with more domains, so I think I should be using Google Tag Manager, but you would tell me if hired. I need help. Things I want to track/know: - How many people click this big ‘continue’ button on my primary domain? How many try to exit my install process? - How many hit track_install? (which is a url that doesn’t exist on my domain, however the Google Chrome Store allows me to input my domain and will feed by Analytics when an install occurs in the Google Chrome Store of my extension) - How many hit /webstore/detail/… (which is again, another URL that Google Chrome Store will hit my analytics with so that I can track conversions/rates of how my Google Chrome Store description page is working for me -- thus, if I try different text or screenshots, it could affect my conversion rate) - How many people hit /success/ (prob same amount as track_install) [The /success/ page is called after the user installs extension1. We then call that same /success/ page after the user installs extension2. Both times we hit one of our domains for that url, the thinking is that tracking the conversions will be easier. If you work with me, I’d like your thoughts on this, as well as our other urls in order to ensure proper conversion tracking] - Setup a funnel for the 2-4 steps involved for the user to install both of my extensions (the How many people uninstall? (When they do uninstall either extension, we call an uninstall URL on both domains) - How many people hit my websites and I present an error page to them, because I do not support their browser? (My extensions are only for Firefox and Chrome desktop web browsers) - I have another subdomain on one of the domains, and then this 3rd domain, which both display search results to users. I’m thinking of removing the 3rd domain, and the subdomain on the other domain, and simply putting the search results at ‘/search/’ on both domains; I think this would simplify things, but wasn’t really thinking about that at the time we developed these. I’d like to discuss this with you if you’re hired. - How many searches happened today on each site? (I use Google Custom Search Engine -- CSE) I have not bought adwords ads yet, but I plan to do that and want everything ready to do that, so that I can know when certain adgroups/keywords are not converting for me (and vice-versa, which ones are working great and I should spend more).

The data will be extracted from finance.yahoo.com (under Historical Data when getting a stock quote). I will plot the efficient frontier for the pair of stocks and determine the minimum variance portfolio of the two, as will, this calculation going to be repeated for other four pairs of stocks (e.g., high correlation, low correlation, negative correlation, etc.). Then I will give a brief explanation for why the most highly correlated pair have such a correlation (e.g., related to their business activities), and similarly for the pair with the least correlation. Then, I'm going to explore an additional of risk-free assets, and what conclusion can be draw in relation to one of portfolios from what we discussed in classes. For the 10 stocks together using 2 years of daily data I am going to estimate the covariance and find sets of portfolio weights that maximize return, minimize risk, and maximize the Sharpe ratio. As will for the cases when short-selling is allowed and is not allowed and write a discussion of the results. The fundamental goal of portfolio theory is to optimally allocate the investments between different assets. Mean variance optimization (MVO) is a quantitative tool that will allow us to make this allocation by considering the trade-off between risk and return. In conventional single period (MVO), I will make the portfolio allocation for a single upcoming period, and the goal will be to maximize the expected return subject to a selected level of risk. Single period (MVO) was developed in the pioneering work of Markowitz. The single period Markowitz algorithm solves the following problem: Inputs: o The expected return for each asset o The standard deviation of each asset (a measure of risk) o The correlation matrix between these assets Output: o The efficient frontier, i.e. the set of portfolios with expected return greater than any other with the same or lesser risk, and lesser risk than any other with the same or greater return. The efficient frontier is conventionally plotted on a graph with the standard deviation (risk) on the horizontal axis, and the expected return on the vertical axis. The basic principles of balancing risk and return may already be appreciated in a two-asset portfolio. less","Mathematics, Presentations, Statistics, Financial Reports,  ",NA,"$400 ","4.99 Stars, based on 4 feedbacks","Canada",NA,4.99,4

We are also interested in where applications to certain lenders fall in a sequence, and whether that application was made in isolation, or as part of a cluster of applications. Background: Our service connects users with various lending options based on their profile. The average number of applications per user is approximately 1.6, which has a skewed distribution to a long tail that can stretch to 10 or more applications. A user will sometimes apply to several options in 1 single sessions, and sometimes can wait several months before applying again. We are trying to gain insights from the order and time differences in which the applications are made to ascertain if certain lending options should be presented at different times, or not at all. ‘Success’ for our business is measured in Transactions, ie: the application leads to an approval and there is commission earned. The magnitude of the commission is secondary to whether there is a commission at all. Data Fields: ApplicationID - integer string - unique for each application UserID - integer string - unique for each user StatusID - numerical code for status of the application, which is one of 6 possible codes. User Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the user joined the platform Application Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the application was created Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Week# - simple breakdown of Application Created Date into components LenderID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each lender PartnerID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each affiliate partner Credit Score ID - numerical indicator (from 1 to 5) denoting the user’s credit score band (eg: Fair, Good, Excellent etc.) Transaction Value - currency string - value of the commission arising from an application, if any. Transaction Date - when the transaction occurred App. Rec. - if the application was created during the month-end reconciliation process. Any row where this value = 1 has a Transaction Date that is earlier than the Application Date, and thus any analysis comparing those 2 fields should exclude these rows. less","Apache Hive, Knime, R, Python",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Canada",NA,NA,NA

Node, edges information attributes should come from a CSV spreadsheet. The csv file should have an information value that has its own assumed growth rate like consumption of number of books over a period of time with dollar numbers for each book. Lets say, one user consumes a book a week and each book has cost of x with margin of y and if the user likes the book or not. I would then be able to show how books are being consumed and if someone likes the book who would receive a recommendation. This way I could study which book is successful based on in- and out-degree distribution. I could show how the community is growing as a network and what books are more successful and if it is because the users are price sensitive or not. Ideally the information attribute for one node would have one information value that has its own assumed growth rate like consumption of number of books over a period of time per node. The code should also visualise growth and volume over time in a separate output. The model should consider time (change of relationship) and events (positive & negative influence of growing the network). The network model (scale-free) should include input options the following assumptions: n(integer) - Number of Nodes in the Graph alpha (float) - Probability for adding a new node connected to an existing node chosen randomly according to the in-degree distribution beta(float) - Probability for adding an edge between two exisiting nodes. One existing node is chosen randomly according to the in-degree distribution and the other chosen randomly according to the out-degree distribution. gamma(float) - Probability for adding a new node connected to an exsisting node chosen randomly according to the out-degree distribution delta_in(float) - Bias for choosing nodes from in-degree distribution. delta_out(flaot) - Bias for choosing nodes from out-degree distribution. create_using - (graph, optional(default MultiDiGraph)) - Use this graph instance to start the process (default = 3-cycle). seed - (integer, optional) - Seed for random number generator OR growth rate that will adjust above input values to fit the input growth rate assumed for the network.

Alternatively, I could set up a scanner or watchlist or something to define the symbol list? (forgive me I'm not a TS user yet).

This would entail: - frontend for website visitor/potential sponsor (user needs to be able to view and filter results), select a profile, register and complete payment - we then need an admin area for the sponsor, to be able to log in and view messages from their child/correspond/share images. This area would also need to be moderated by an administrator of the website. - we then, of course, need a backend/CMS for site administrator to upload images, video and text for the child profiles; along with all the other general CMS for editing website. - statistics/analytics/reporting would be essential In addition to the child profiles, there'd be approximately 12-14 static pages. I'm very familiar with Wordpress – would love for it to be a Wordpress site but will take your advice on whether you think it has enough capability for all that this site needs to do. Hosting, sitemap and designs (done in Sketch or XD) will be supplied.

Lastly, the website should be mobile friendly despite the format of the home page (looking like a book - please see attached file ""Websites Illustration""). Additionally, the website should be easily edited - for example, if I need to add a new project, add a new animal for an adaption, or change wording or some photographs throughout the site.

Our stack consists of: an AIRTABLE backend, ZAPIER, G-SUITE, PandaDoc, and a couple of PYTHON scripts that are 'scraping' tools designed to access online external databases that hold information on projects that need to hire our clients. Currently, we use an Airtable Form to overwrite non-changing data to send HTML Emails and create follow-ups and adhere somewhat to lax business rules. We need better views or ways of being able to work with the data we're collecting. Dashboards. We also have almost completed our new client onboarding process based on PandaDoc collecting data from new clients and having it populate Airtable, QBO, Google Drive, Etc. For internal project management, we use ASANA. We are working on a new invoicing and accounts payable system using DOCPARSER for processing of checks for account receivable and ZAPIER to follow business rules to pay out clients from the funds we receive. DOCPARSER instantly creates the proper entries in QBO including a BILL which our PLOOTO EFT system pays once it goes thru a human approval step. These modules are hosted on Google Sites. We love our ideas now we just want to properly execute them as one system. My budget is NOT massive. It's a real hurdle, so I'm hoping that the right person who knows the right package can take our processes and deliver us something that is less stressful to maintain and FIX. Basic deliverables to start are: 1. create a secure 'company website' so we can easily send out templated HTML VERY IMPORTANT emails to our clients using a form prepopulated with any data that already exists in the system. A set of business rules for follow-up must also be implemented. So someone who understands business process design will be invaluable. 2. create meaningful management reports and dashboards on the success of each of the project we compete for plus data on trends that our buyers are following. Also, I would love to be able to have the contribution of each client to out P/L avail on demand. 3. fix and enhance our client onboarding process. It's 80% there, I just have no time. And could use someone else's ideas on how to make it better. It would be great if we could design a secure portal for clients to upload new materials (demo materials, photos, etc.) to help us in our jobs. Also to give them self serve options for changing their statistical information/gaining access to YTD Earning and fees paid to us etc. 4. track opportunities coming to clients who may not be on our team. Developing an instant and aggressive push to have our clients considered for these opportunities (if they fit.) This is a business process that we can create to be triggered by a simple email parser and simple email templates and auto reminders to make phone calls. 5. redesign a commission calculator for our employees. Eventually, I'd like to move more of the responsibility of monthly commission reporting to my employees. I spend too many hours on it. 6. (Complex perhaps) a contract tracking system for TVC projects that need to be renewed and renegotiated before the term expires. This should track as much intelligence as possible and present us with actionable outputs. 7. other ideas your brilliant minds may have on items that can be made self-service or automated. Perhaps time off requests, or other HR functions? Or any cool plugins to whatever CRM system I'm sure I'm going to need. It would be great if you could find a way to SAVE me money on the many subscriptions services I have at the present time. I wish it were not the case but COST does play a significant factor here. So if this sounds interesting please sharpen your pencil and bring me the best value/rate you're able to. It's always so nice when a long-term relationship is formed, and that's what I'm looking for. We have a shared contact list of 8000 people, about 200 clients in Canada, LA and around the world. While we are a small lean operation, we're busier than most everybody. If all of our systems spoke to each other, that would be amazing and there is almost no end to the creative projects we could take on here. I t would be great if you could start soon, too! I'm wondering if PODIO is the answer? Let me know what you think? If interested, please send over a CV and tell me about your expertise (required) in the technologies that you feel this project needs to move to (or keep) and a short note about why you have interest in this job.

These may range from better decision-making and reduced bullying, to increased sales performance or improved productivity. The massage program will concentrate on teams and look at what is holding back each individual team - maybe stress, anxiety, fatigue etc. Pain is also one area, but massage takes care of that. So, as you can see, we are aiming to show massage affects objective and subjective KPIs. We will calculate the ROI of the program, and present the results in report form. Before and after each massage we survey staff as to how they feel, which is how we get the data. I need your help in the wording and terminology used, and how to best structure the questions we ask to get the most out of it. I work with you drawing up the questions during the session, so you are acting more as a consultant to me. Partly because I need to build the wording into the database, and I may find I need to ask more questions as we go along. My mind works by laying the tracks as we work out where we are going. Handing the job over to be done in X time doesn't work for me. If you are cool with that, then I'd love to talk. The pre-requisites are that you know how business thinks, and you have experience dealing with or working on workplace mental health issues. This program is currently in the testing phase at the moment, and I am starting on Thursday 6/6, so I would like to do a session potentially Wednesday 5/6 over the phone (or even in person if you are in Sydney). I will be meeting the person I am testing the program with on Tuesday 4/6 and I will gather the basis of what I need to then develop the program further. I know that sounds tight, but you may just be OK with that! If all works well, and we gel together, I will be needing services similar to yours over the coming months, so hopefully you wont be a FIFO person. Ask me what you need, and I'll respond back by Sunday night.

The attached images are examples of what others have done. I want to build something similar but have my own metrics in mind (e.g. price/volume changes over many different time intervals, basic statistical analysis of the price/volume data, comparison of price/volume data to a couple of benchmarks, etc). I had a developer build a program to pull in price/volume data from various exchanges. The data is coming to my server (AWS) every 5 minutes. The site/server is an AWS EC2 and the developer used MySQL + Python + Flask for the build. We were originally trying to push the data to Google-sheets but aborted that after considerable difficulty. I need someone to upgrade the current system so that it's easy to use. I'm looking for someone that is good with APIs, databases and web/app development. The plan is to upgrade this to a commercial grade website and/or mobile app later (separate, larger project). Tasks required (Milestones) 1. Check exchange API feeds for accuracy and efficiency, and figure out system in place for selecting which coins' data to pull via the APIs (what's in place is a bit confusing to me) ($100) 2. Data feed adjustments (see details in attached Word doc) ($250) - Remove feed from Cryptopia and ensure Binance, Bittrex, Okex and Huobi are working well - Price (BTC & USD) for 6-hr and 12-hr time-intervals for top 300 coins (from CoinMarketCap, based on market cap ranking) - Live update of market cap of each coin that is being pulled from exchanges (data from CMC) - Upgrade system to capture buy and sell volume (separately) for each selected coin/exchange (every 5 minutes) 3. Check that the existing CSV download function is working properly (easily downloads, data correct) and fix any issues ($100) 4. Build output table(s) for the feed of data on the site, configure the system to do the required analysis and build output pages/sections in visually appealing format (output formats are WIP but details are in the attached word doc). Some conditional formatting will be required. TBD ($650) 5. Upgrade the CMS to be more user-friendly, allow multiple users (admin & regular) and restrict some sections/controls to only admin (note: new account UN/PW created manually by admins) ($150) 6. Build easy/auto-archive system to export ""old"" data to online storage (e.g. GoogleDrive, preferably as CSV/excel files) and then easy way for the data to be deleted (ie. manually, by selecting the exchange and the dates of data to delete...admin only privilege) ($150) 7. Additional visualization improvements on the output sections (example: line graphs for various time periods using price data in the DB) ($400) **Note: The developer who helped build the current system may also be involved on this project and the milestones may be split.
