We are also interested in where applications to certain lenders fall in a sequence, and whether that application was made in isolation, or as part of a cluster of applications. Background: Our service connects users with various lending options based on their profile. The average number of applications per user is approximately 1.6, which has a skewed distribution to a long tail that can stretch to 10 or more applications. A user will sometimes apply to several options in 1 single sessions, and sometimes can wait several months before applying again. We are trying to gain insights from the order and time differences in which the applications are made to ascertain if certain lending options should be presented at different times, or not at all. ‘Success’ for our business is measured in Transactions, ie: the application leads to an approval and there is commission earned. The magnitude of the commission is secondary to whether there is a commission at all. Data Fields: ApplicationID - integer string - unique for each application UserID - integer string - unique for each user StatusID - numerical code for status of the application, which is one of 6 possible codes. User Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the user joined the platform Application Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the application was created Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Week# - simple breakdown of Application Created Date into components LenderID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each lender PartnerID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each affiliate partner Credit Score ID - numerical indicator (from 1 to 5) denoting the user’s credit score band (eg: Fair, Good, Excellent etc.) Transaction Value - currency string - value of the commission arising from an application, if any. Transaction Date - when the transaction occurred App. Rec. - if the application was created during the month-end reconciliation process. Any row where this value = 1 has a Transaction Date that is earlier than the Application Date, and thus any analysis comparing those 2 fields should exclude these rows. less","Apache Hive, Knime, R, Python",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Canada",NA,NA,NA
