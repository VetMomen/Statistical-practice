I have a couple of browser extensions that I want to track installs (“Conversions/Goals”) for in Google Analytics. I have two browser extensions, which are on two different domains and then there’s a 3rd domain that is also involved that displays search results for one of the browser extensions.

I have Google Analytics setup, however it’s not setup properly and I am not an expert by any means. I have two extensions at the moment, but there will be more in the future with more domains, so I think I should be using Google Tag Manager, but you would tell me if hired. I need help. Things I want to track/know: - How many people click this big ‘continue’ button on my primary domain? How many try to exit my install process? - How many hit track_install? (which is a url that doesn’t exist on my domain, however the Google Chrome Store allows me to input my domain and will feed by Analytics when an install occurs in the Google Chrome Store of my extension) - How many hit /webstore/detail/… (which is again, another URL that Google Chrome Store will hit my analytics with so that I can track conversions/rates of how my Google Chrome Store description page is working for me -- thus, if I try different text or screenshots, it could affect my conversion rate) - How many people hit /success/ (prob same amount as track_install) [The /success/ page is called after the user installs extension1. We then call that same /success/ page after the user installs extension2. Both times we hit one of our domains for that url, the thinking is that tracking the conversions will be easier. If you work with me, I’d like your thoughts on this, as well as our other urls in order to ensure proper conversion tracking] - Setup a funnel for the 2-4 steps involved for the user to install both of my extensions (the How many people uninstall? (When they do uninstall either extension, we call an uninstall URL on both domains) - How many people hit my websites and I present an error page to them, because I do not support their browser? (My extensions are only for Firefox and Chrome desktop web browsers) - I have another subdomain on one of the domains, and then this 3rd domain, which both display search results to users. I’m thinking of removing the 3rd domain, and the subdomain on the other domain, and simply putting the search results at ‘/search/’ on both domains; I think this would simplify things, but wasn’t really thinking about that at the time we developed these. I’d like to discuss this with you if you’re hired. - How many searches happened today on each site? (I use Google Custom Search Engine -- CSE) I have not bought adwords ads yet, but I plan to do that and want everything ready to do that, so that I can know when certain adgroups/keywords are not converting for me (and vice-versa, which ones are working great and I should spend more).
