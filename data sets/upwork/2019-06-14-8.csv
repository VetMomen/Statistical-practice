I suspect that these equations might provide some insight to the nature of things and help us describe the world in a way where we will all be at one with the world. The background for this experiment is as follows: My family and I lives on a remote island of less than 5 thousand people in the Grenadines for 3 months out of the year. For those who are interested, the name of the island is Bequia and its located here. https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bequia/@13.0164508,-61.2803282,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c4759437bd039cd:0x56b113ca888f4ce6!8m2!3d13.0117059!4d-61.2272312 The island has been hardly touched my man and 90% of the land is as natural as nature made it. As I write this post, it’s about 85 degrees with a semi-cool ocean breeze. Nevertheless, nature is all around us 24/7. I’ve never seen and paid attention to so many various of life. I spend hours looking at the birds and how they fly and the mastery show of flight that the perform for the world. I also notice the pattern in the trees, the leaves, etc. Yesterday in fact, I was looking at the mountains on the island and I saw what looked Sine ways; but discontinuous sine ways. Then I had a thought. What if I could map an equation(s) to the 3 dimensional contours of the mountains? What information could we obtain and/or derive from such equations? After all, the topology of the mountain chain, was made by nature. And we all know that nature is the most efficient and best engineer and/or scientist we know. At the end of the day; nature always win. The key to creating the waveforms is the data. How do we gather the data to create the plots, and equations? For this we go back to nature. Because nature is perfect and is far more intelligent than man, we know that the nature must have had created a easy way for such to find the data that we seek for. In fact, that data is around us, in us, a part us at all time; we live in this data. Nature would of made the data to be a random set of numbers. Why, because if you were nature and knew all you would create a state, such that your creation would be able to pick any number of set of numbers to know itself.
