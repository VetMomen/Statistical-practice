I want to see how conversion rate of paid traffic has changed, before and after that change. 2. We cancelled a referral softare system recently. I want to see how referral traffic has changed, and how much that accounted for for us 3. We raised prices back in January of this year. I want to see how that affected AOV and conversion rate 4. Finally, we started recently using a partner that drives a lot of traffic, although it's low quality. Looking to see if that's having a negative affect on our retargetting paid performance (us paying to retarget low quality traffic) less","Google Analytics",NA,"$2k+ ","5.00 Stars, based on 1 feedback","United States",NA,5,1

Our traffic offseason is about a few hundred thousand sessions per month. In the high season, we increase into the tens of millions; with a few days peaking at a few million users. We operate worldwide on a global scale in 4 languages. Our current marketing channels include: Email Paid ( Search, retargeting and App) Organic Social PR Objective: Track 100% (or close to) of all users ( and their applicable data sets) across all platforms (Desktop and Mobile Apps) with the ability to easily apply attribution of the user's source and conversion and break down the data by country - on demand. Examples of some data we need to track: * New and returning users action on site (cross-platform) (Using their PNP User ID) * Sign in * Sign up * Actions & funnel conversions (email sign up, free video creation, paid products) * The path on site and app * Transactions (purchases and revenue) * Device used * Language (based on data they entered into our platform) * Location (based on data they entered into our platform) * Vouchers redeem * A/B testing: Landing pages/prices * KPIs breakdown by country /platform (content created by type, product purchased by type, conversion rate user & buyers, etc) Current Challenges: * During our peak, we lose approximately 20% of our user count ( and corresponding data) in GA. this includes sign up and sign in. * We cannot easily assign campaign attribution for the last touch on mobile apps ( exception for UAC campaigns on Google). * We cannot track cross-platform. I.E: We acquire an install and user via Apple Search Ads, but user becomes a paid user via email on our mobile responsive site. * Easily track A/B tests * The data layer is not set correctly. Desktop and mobile app do not match * Only have a JR BI Internal resource * Web and mobile tracking are very different and should be merged if possible. * The platform is built using angular JS/native script. Goals for 2019: * Refactoring and normalization of the tracking code cross platforms (ex: Data Layer) * Lead technical implementation of tracking and build documentation (ex: GTM configuration) * Automate reports as much as possible (ex: GA / Bigquery / Tableau) * Train JR BI resource to manage both in season and post mortem activities and the current setup we have in place. Analytics Stack: GA 360 - Connected to GTM, BigQuerry, Google ads, and Firebase and associated with both desktop and mobile app. Appsflyer - Connected to Apple App Store and Google Play store.

We are also interested in where applications to certain lenders fall in a sequence, and whether that application was made in isolation, or as part of a cluster of applications. Background: Our service connects users with various lending options based on their profile. The average number of applications per user is approximately 1.6, which has a skewed distribution to a long tail that can stretch to 10 or more applications. A user will sometimes apply to several options in 1 single sessions, and sometimes can wait several months before applying again. We are trying to gain insights from the order and time differences in which the applications are made to ascertain if certain lending options should be presented at different times, or not at all. ‘Success’ for our business is measured in Transactions, ie: the application leads to an approval and there is commission earned. The magnitude of the commission is secondary to whether there is a commission at all. Data Fields: ApplicationID - integer string - unique for each application UserID - integer string - unique for each user StatusID - numerical code for status of the application, which is one of 6 possible codes. User Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the user joined the platform Application Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the application was created Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Week# - simple breakdown of Application Created Date into components LenderID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each lender PartnerID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each affiliate partner Credit Score ID - numerical indicator (from 1 to 5) denoting the user’s credit score band (eg: Fair, Good, Excellent etc.) Transaction Value - currency string - value of the commission arising from an application, if any. Transaction Date - when the transaction occurred App. Rec. - if the application was created during the month-end reconciliation process.

Node, edges information attributes should come from a CSV spreadsheet. The csv file should have an information value that has its own assumed growth rate like consumption of number of books over a period of time with dollar numbers for each book. Lets say, one user consumes a book a week and each book has cost of x with margin of y and if the user likes the book or not. I would then be able to show how books are being consumed and if someone likes the book who would receive a recommendation. This way I could study which book is successful based on in- and out-degree distribution. I could show how the community is growing as a network and what books are more successful and if it is because the users are price sensitive or not. Ideally the information attribute for one node would have one information value that has its own assumed growth rate like consumption of number of books over a period of time per node. The code should also visualise growth and volume over time in a separate output. The model should consider time (change of relationship) and events (positive & negative influence of growing the network). The network model (scale-free) should include input options the following assumptions: n(integer) - Number of Nodes in the Graph alpha (float) - Probability for adding a new node connected to an existing node chosen randomly according to the in-degree distribution beta(float) - Probability for adding an edge between two exisiting nodes.

I don't want to download historic data one stock at a time, I want to be able to batch process multiple symbols consecutively (or say, 100 at a time for example). For example, I could create a csv file with a number of tickers on it. TS tool would then download stock data for each of these symbols (one at a time or whatever works in TS). Alternatively, I could set up a scanner or watchlist or something to define the symbol list? (forgive me I'm not a TS user yet). Whatever the maximum number of stocks on that csv file could be - you tell me? Ideally it should be at 100 at the very least. In total, I might want to download history for over 2000 stocks. I'm looking for: US stocks. Minute data (5m ok). Including EOD data would be good. I would also like DE-LISTED stock data (I'm sure this can be done, I've seen it in TS before). I would want ALL the history available in TS. Or, just in case, ideally I could specify start and end date. Ideally I could update from time to time and just download additional data since last download (not mandatory). I don't mind if downloads are to csv files - I don't mind if each stock has it's own file. I'm only after: Date, Time, O, H, L, C, V for each stock. Data should be back-adjusted for splits (Tradestation minute data has this I believe). I obviously want to retain the tool and code for future use myself. Basically, something like this that could be run on more than one stock at a time: https://www.usingeasylanguage.com/buy-now/tradestation-data-export-tool/ If you don't speak fluent English or don't understand trading-data related concepts then you are probably not the right person for this job. less","TradeStation",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Australia",NA,NA,NA

When a user browses our product page, we append product IDs into the URL bar (all products are opened in modals inside one page, not unique pages). We need to track how many products each individual user looks at, not just how many products were looked at overall... user specific. The hardest and most important part (this job will go to whoever has a solution for this one): - We have several web forms on our site that are included on the site via an iFrame from a remote URL. We have no ability to directly track this URL as it's on a remote server and we cannot bring the page onto the local site as this form is required to be in it's current location. We need a way to track conversations (people who submit these forms) in our GA tracking. Is there a way to create some sort of JS event listener that can ""see"" what happens inside the iFrame and report it in our analytics? Essentially, we need to be able to see and say: User 1 looked at three products then completed the web form inside of the remote URL iframe. We also need to set up clearly defined UTMs to track sources to conversions. less","Analytics, Conversion Rate Optimization, Google Analytics API, JavaScript",NA,"$60k+ ","5.00 Stars, based on 22 feedbacks","United States",NA,5,22

Intuition and gut instinct are not enough anymore. *Tasks* We need a Growth Ninja who can dig in Google Analytics and Optimize to regularly offer new actionable growth tactics: <U+274F> keyword opportunities (e.g. low hanging keywords) <U+274F> content maintenance (e.g. articles to update to boost rankings) <U+274F> digital product ideas (e.g. course targeting a keyword group, ebooks, etc) <U+274F> email optin growth (e.g. content upgrade ideas) <U+274F> optin list activation (e.g. more engaging email automations) <U+274F> experiments (e.g. use Google Optimize to measure run UX A/B tests) The tools you will mostly use include Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google Optimize, Google Spreadsheets, and ActiveCampaign (although a lot less). *SEO & Organic Keywords* Although your role is not to be search engine optimizer per se, solid knowledge of inbound marketing, search engine optimization strategies, and Google Search Console is required. Our traffic is mostly coming via organic search so your role is to grow this channel while enabling other channels (e.g. email list, social) to also increase their share. *Google Analytics* You must be an expert at digging in all of Google Analytics reports, tables, charts. The goal is not to state the obvious or what is working. Instead, your role is to consistently suggest growth tactics that are backed by the data. Some examples: Your Pinterest traffic doubled over the last six months – try adding a poster to every new article and let’s measure the growth Here are ten keywords you are not exactly targeting yet but rank 10-13th on SERPS – write articles on these to target top 3 fast after publication A lot of keywords you rank for are about solving the problem X – write a mini-course and promote it from these related blog posts Again, the goal of our Growth Ninja is to find new traffic and income sources. Come up with ideas and plans to try out. Do not base these on some random content marketing influencer you follow, but based on our existing data. Not everything will perform, but a lot will! Google Optimize A/B testing is key to measure the actual effects of UX changes against a specific metric. Whether we want to increase email opt-ins or the bounce rate, a UX change through A/B testing can let us know whether it should be definitely changed, or not. As a Growth Ninja, your role is to come up with potentially rewarding changes that will impact the business’ bottom line. We will regularly brainstorm metrics that matter, long and short term goals, and set up experiments with Optimize. You will follow and judge these. Compensation The budget for this role is between $4 and $9 per hour. It consists of a few hours every week as well as weekly video meetings. Increases are very much possible as long as your suggestions and business insights are meaningful and help us grow the bottom line.

After the building mask is extracted from the satellite image via semantic segmentation, the building shape is often irregular. The objective is to regularise the building shapes via the algorithm developed. The algorithm should take care of only the regularisation/polygonisation part. The segmentation part is already completed. The algorithm has to be developed in Python and should not use any paid API calls. The solution may use the polyline compression algorithm to correct distortions in building footprint polygons created through semantic segmentation that may produce undesirable artifacts. The developed solution should not use standard approaches, e.g. the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which are greedy in nature. The solution may use some priori building properties, which can be manually set. Some properties for example can be: 1. The building edge must be of at least some length, both relative and absolute, e.g. 3 meters 2. Consecutive edge angles are likely to be 90 degrees 3. Consecutive angles cannot be very sharp, smaller by some auto-tuned threshold, e.g. 30 degrees 4. Building angles likely have very few dominant angles, meaning all building edges are forming an angle of (dominant angle ± n?/2) To summarise, the solution can follow any logic to output regularised polygons with min no of vertices. The regularisation process should take less than a sec for each polygon., in total for a large area with 10,000 polygons, the process should not take more than few mins. At the time of bidding, kindly explain your algorithm in brief (just the building blocks so that I get a rough idea where we are headed). For solution acceptance, a processed mask (building footprint) will be shared as a numpy file and you will have to share the corresponding regularised mask along with time statistics. less","Python, Algorithms, Geographic Information System (GIS, ",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","India",NA,NA,NA
