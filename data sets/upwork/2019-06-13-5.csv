The data will be extracted from finance.yahoo.com (under Historical Data when getting a stock quote). I will plot the efficient frontier for the pair of stocks and determine the minimum variance portfolio of the two, as will, this calculation going to be repeated for other four pairs of stocks (e.g., high correlation, low correlation, negative correlation, etc.). Then I will give a brief explanation for why the most highly correlated pair have such a correlation (e.g., related to their business activities), and similarly for the pair with the least correlation. Then, I'm going to explore an additional of risk-free assets, and what conclusion can be draw in relation to one of portfolios from what we discussed in classes. For the 10 stocks together using 2 years of daily data I am going to estimate the covariance and find sets of portfolio weights that maximize return, minimize risk, and maximize the Sharpe ratio. As will for the cases when short-selling is allowed and is not allowed and write a discussion of the results. The fundamental goal of portfolio theory is to optimally allocate the investments between different assets. Mean variance optimization (MVO) is a quantitative tool that will allow us to make this allocation by considering the trade-off between risk and return. In conventional single period (MVO), I will make the portfolio allocation for a single upcoming period, and the goal will be to maximize the expected return subject to a selected level of risk. Single period (MVO) was developed in the pioneering work of Markowitz. The single period Markowitz algorithm solves the following problem: Inputs: o The expected return for each asset o The standard deviation of each asset (a measure of risk) o The correlation matrix between these assets Output: o The efficient frontier, i.e. the set of portfolios with expected return greater than any other with the same or lesser risk, and lesser risk than any other with the same or greater return. The efficient frontier is conventionally plotted on a graph with the standard deviation (risk) on the horizontal axis, and the expected return on the vertical axis. The basic principles of balancing risk and return may already be appreciated in a two-asset portfolio. less","Mathematics, Presentations, Statistics, Financial Reports,  ",NA,"$400 ","4.99 Stars, based on 4 feedbacks","Canada",NA,4.99,4

I want to build something similar but have my own metrics in mind (e.g. price/volume changes over many different time intervals, basic statistical analysis of the price/volume data, comparison of price/volume data to a couple of benchmarks, etc). I had a developer build a program to pull in price/volume data from various exchanges. The data is coming to my server (AWS) every 5 minutes. The site/server is an AWS EC2 and the developer used MySQL + Python + Flask for the build. We were originally trying to push the data to Google-sheets but aborted that after considerable difficulty. I need someone to upgrade the current system so that it's easy to use. I'm looking for someone that is good with APIs, databases and web/app development. The plan is to upgrade this to a commercial grade website and/or mobile app later (separate, larger project). Tasks required (Milestones) 1. Check exchange API feeds for accuracy and efficiency, and figure out system in place for selecting which coins' data to pull via the APIs (what's in place is a bit confusing to me) ($100) 2. Data feed adjustments (see details in attached Word doc) ($250) - Remove feed from Cryptopia and ensure Binance, Bittrex, Okex and Huobi are working well - Price (BTC & USD) for 6-hr and 12-hr time-intervals for top 300 coins (from CoinMarketCap, based on market cap ranking) - Live update of market cap of each coin that is being pulled from exchanges (data from CMC) - Upgrade system to capture buy and sell volume (separately) for each selected coin/exchange (every 5 minutes) 3. Check that the existing CSV download function is working properly (easily downloads, data correct) and fix any issues ($100) 4. Build output table(s) for the feed of data on the site, configure the system to do the required analysis and build output pages/sections in visually appealing format (output formats are WIP but details are in the attached word doc). Some conditional formatting will be required. TBD ($650) 5. Upgrade the CMS to be more user-friendly, allow multiple users (admin & regular) and restrict some sections/controls to only admin (note: new account UN/PW created manually by admins) ($150) 6. Build easy/auto-archive system to export ""old"" data to online storage (e.g. GoogleDrive, preferably as CSV/excel files) and then easy way for the data to be deleted (ie. manually, by selecting the exchange and the dates of data to delete...admin only privilege) ($150) 7. Additional visualization improvements on the output sections (example: line graphs for various time periods using price data in the DB) ($400) **Note: The developer who helped build the current system may also be involved on this project and the milestones may be split.

The initiative aims to complement efforts currently underway to develop an official indicator framework for monitoring the SDGs. The Inter-agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) has identified 23 global indicators under SDG16’s 12 targets. It is intended that national statistical systems will eventually produce the majority of the data for these indicators. The UN Statistical System and other global organizations will then collate this official data at the global level. However, official data availability and coverage is currently limited and it may take years to develop the necessary capacities and collect data for official monitoring through official statistical systems. In the interim, we should draw on available data to help countries to begin monitoring SDG16. The SDG16DI, formed by a group of organizations with expertise in these areas, aims to fill this role. The initiative is an attempt to pull together data sets in an open format in order to track SDG16 and provide an easily accessible snapshot of the current situation, and eventually of progress, over time. To this end, we include both global and complementary indicators, presented with official and unofficial data. The process also seeks to identify potential challenges in data quality, availability, and coverage that need to be addressed. 2019 Global Report: • Web optimized version to be housed at SDG16report.org • Print version with 45-50 predicted number of pages • US Letter size format of report • Layout incorporates substantial text (roughly 20,000 words), photos and data visualizations Specific design elements: • A two-page spread of a side by side visual comparison of the data availability for only official data and official data and non-official data • 2-4 Visualization graphics per chapters (11 chapters) –in the form of graphs and charts, in quarter and half page sizes • Each target chapter and the executive summary will be written and designed in order to be pulled out as a standalone issue brief. There will be 11 chapters that each include their own visualizations of the data to aid in the reader’s comprehension.

If the trade situation changes and the price is hitting the other way as expected the EA is supposed to open additional orders for both opened positions (max. 5 for each position).Every following opened position must have a difference of 2% between each additional orders. This is called hedging with grid elements. EA must analyze the price movement on each instrument to consider the trend direction.

In general, it's a good idea to focus on quantifiable data, such as &quot; I will enter a pairs trade when price ratio exceeds two standard deviations.&quot; Buy the underperformer and sell the overperformer. In practice, a pair transaction works as follows: at one time, we buy the undervalued currencies and sell the overvalued. If the assumption of the reunification of their prices is confirmed (which has been statistically proven), we collect the profit. It is irrelevant whether the profit is generated by the growth of the undervalued, a drop in the overvalued one, or any other combination of price fluctuations.

"174","Regularisation/Polygonization of Building Footprints extracted from Satellite Images","https://www.upwork.com/job/Regularisation-Polygonization-Building-Footprints-extracted-from-Satellite-Images_~014394a9a8ade95a3e/","Intermediate",120,2019-05-22,"The objective of the project is to develop an algorithm to normalize the footprint of building polygons by eliminating undesirable artifacts in their geometry. After the building mask is extracted from the satellite image via semantic segmentation, the building shape is often irregular. The objective is to regularise the building shapes via the algorithm developed. The algorithm should take care of only the regularisation/polygonisation part. The segmentation part is already completed. The algorithm has to be developed in Python and should not use any paid API calls. The solution may use the polyline compression algorithm to correct distortions in building footprint polygons created through semantic segmentation that may produce undesirable artifacts. The developed solution should not use standard approaches, e.g. the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which are greedy in nature. The solution may use some priori building properties, which can be manually set. Some properties for example can be: 1. The building edge must be of at least some length, both relative and absolute, e.g. 3 meters 2. Consecutive edge angles are likely to be 90 degrees 3. Consecutive angles cannot be very sharp, smaller by some auto-tuned threshold, e.g. 30 degrees 4. Building angles likely have very few dominant angles, meaning all building edges are forming an angle of (dominant angle ± n?/2) To summarise, the solution can follow any logic to output regularised polygons with min no of vertices. The regularisation process should take less than a sec for each polygon., in total for a large area with 10,000 polygons, the process should not take more than few mins. At the time of bidding, kindly explain your algorithm in brief (just the building blocks so that I get a rough idea where we are headed). For solution acceptance, a processed mask (building footprint) will be shared as a numpy file and you will have to share the corresponding regularised mask along with time statistics. less","Python, Algorithms, Geographic Information System (GIS, ",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","India",NA,NA,NA

The paper is about Krippendorff's alpha for the reliability of unitizing textual continua. Here are more details: I am a linguist working on a language project in which I have two annotators to identify noun phrases in natural texts. For example, given these three 'dummy' sentences: 1) I was the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop. 2) I didn't believe her. Annotator 1 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe her. Annotator 2 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl] with [blue eyes] in [the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe [her]. The differences between the two annotators are due to (1) not applying the maximal principle according to which all elements modifying the head noun need to be tagged within the same NP span, and (2) not considering a particular chunk as a NP. The two annotators are done doing their jobs and now I need to know how reliable the annotations are. I looked in the literature and I found out about Krippendorff's alpha for text unitization (paper attached). The attached paper is the last development of the measure. However, the paper looks like hieroglyphics to me. Therefore, what I need someone with a good background in data analysis, inter-annotator agreement, computational linguistics, and/or natural language processing to explain it to me in simple English, apply it (even roughly manual) to my dummy examples, and answer my questions like: 1. I don't have categories. How can I apply alpha then? 2. How to compute units with perfect beginning and ends but with gaps in between? 3. Which alpha best suits my data? I need to understand the paper well before I decide my next step: whether to use their software, hire a programmer to implement the formulas for me, or just skip this measure and look for another. Notes: 1. Please take a good look into the paper :) This is crucial. 2. This is the latest version of the measure.

Which countries have the lowest and highest GDPs per capita? -Develop a scatter diagram with GDP per capita as the independent variable. What does the scatter diagram indicate about the relationship between the two variables? -Develop and estimate a regression equation that can be used to predict average life satisfaction given GDP per capita. -State the estimated regression equation and interpret the meaning of the slope coefficient (to make the interpretation easier multiply the estimated coefficient by 10,000). -Is there a statistically significant association between GDP per capita and average life satisfaction? What is your conclusion? -Did the regression equation provide a good fit? Explain. -Luxembourg, Ireland, and Norway appear to be outliers in terms of GDP per capita.

We have a team of chat agents who are assigned shifts to cover chats in 5 different languages at this moment. Some agents chat in only two languages while other agents chat in three or even four languages. The statistics of the chats are archived and are accessible through the LiveChat Inc API. The main goal of the application is to analyze these statistics from the LiveChat Inc software, using the provided API, to show how efficient the distribution of shifts was. The user has to be able to define a desired timeframe of any amount of days in the past. Within this timeframe, the application will fetch the reported data using the API to calculate statistics for every hour of the day. Using this data and several user defined parameters, the application has to be able to calculate the optimal distribution of chat agents per hour retrospectively, considering available language combinations that each agent masters, which can then be used to distribute the shifts more efficiently in the future. Firstly, the application has to fetch the total hourly amount of chats during the defined timeframe and display these statistics in the main interface. The application needs a second interface, where all the agent groups fetched from the API are listed. The user of the application needs to be able to define which language the groups belong to. The application needs to be able to support at least 5 (pre-defined), but ideally (practically) unlimited user defined languages for future expansion. The application needs to have a third interface, where a list of all agents will be displayed. For each agent, the user must be able to tick a box for each available language, so the application knows which language combinations are possible. This will be used to suggest a combination of language groups to cover all chats optimally. In the main interface, the user must be able to define which days of the week must be considered or excluded in the statistics. The total should be calculated for all selected by the user within the defined timeframe. A collapsible sub-table for each statistic should be included to display the statistics broken down per language. The application will be based on a provided reference prototype that was conceptualized using MS Excel. See project files. Attached you will also find a list of required features of the application. The above describes the first phase of the job. The files 'Concept custom additional chats.xls' and 'Custom chat distribution prognosis.docx' describe the second phase of the job.
