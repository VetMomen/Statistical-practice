The Crikey business model rests almost entirely on subscription revenue, therefore understanding the path to conversion and reasons for user churn is crucial. While we have a clear idea around insights we are hoping to discover, such as identifying content that is most likely to lead to paid subscribers or behaviours most likely to indicate churn, the right candidate will also look for unexpected, useful insights in the data that paint a richer understanding of our users. Responsibilities: • Source and prototype datasets from available audience segmentation and historical user data to map user journeys, and to inform your analysis. • Customer journey analysis, conversion rate optimisation, data analytics and implementation, data visualisation, running experiments to help inform the user conversion process and deliver customer experience and growth. • Analysis and synthesis of customer journey data to build three (3) detailed scenarios around user journey churn and conversion. (Examples include, behaviour that indicates a likelihood to churn at any point in a user life time, the type of content a user begins their Crikey journey on that indicates likelihood to convert to a paid subscriber, the average time taken for users to convert to paid subscribers and the optimal time to market to users based on this.) • Collaborate with the Crikey associate publisher and Private Media’s Digital lead to integrate and validate user journey metrics through Pardot, Parsely and Wordpress in order to provide the foundations for the user journey dashboard. • Write complex queries in SQL and write scripts to draw out useful business insights around user journeys. So what are we looking for? • Initiative, ownership and accountability for what you say you can and will do • Extensive experience with buyer behaviour and segmentation practices including customer journey mapping and audience personas. • Curiosity and a passion for analysing and using data to determine trends and patterns. • You should enjoy enabling successful commercial outcomes and supporting management to make informed decisions. • 2 years of quantitative and qualitative analyst experience (commercial or academic) • Bachelor degree or higher from a discipline that uses advanced statistical modelling (e.g., Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Econometrics, Marketing, Psychology, etc.). • Experience in data extraction - programming experience in SQL and a corresponding understanding of database schemas, data marts and warehouses, and be a great problem solver. • Experience with Digital Analytics tools like Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics, Parsley and Pardot. • Excellent communication skills and an affinity with data modelling, analysis, and reporting.

The data is from a SQL database with each table representing a control panel within a building. The project is to merge the tables into one table such that all merged fields share a common timestamp. Understanding the Source Data The attached PBIX file has the following tables (A) Several dozen “DataTables” (e.g. ""2000MTL12"") with approx. 8 fields each: ID, Timestamp, TimeChange, Mnemonic1, Mnemonic2, ..., Mnemonic6 (where “Mnemonic” is the name given for the table field names). Note that “DataTable” and “Mnemonic” are the names given to these objects in the reference table BACnet_Config. (B) BACnet_DOPR, which is a table that acts as a cross-reference between the Mnemonic name and what the table calls the “ObjectName” as well as “units”. (c) BACnet_Config, which is a table that cross-reference the Mnemonics with the DataTables they are found in. I don’t think this table is required as the Mnemonics are unique and the originating DataTable names are not needed in the WH. I mentioned the table just in case I am wrong and you need it for the query (D) A number of other tables that aren't important The Project** (1) Merge all the “DataTable” tables into a single new table where each “Mnemonic” shares a common Timestamp (which changes in 30-minute increments). - Where the Timestamp is out by a few seconds between “DataTable” tables make the seconds equal to zero to ensure that the timestamps between tables match perfectly for date and time. - Where the field called TimeChange provides a value delete this row from the tables as this is an error in the data source that supplies Timestamps that do not match the Timestamp records. (2) Replace all the “Mnemonic” field names in the new merged table with the “ObjectName”s in the BACnet_DOPR table. The Mnemonic names are unique and there is a one-to-one relationship in the BACnet_DOPR table between Mnemonic and ObjectName. ** See Excel file for example less",NA,NA,"$20k+ ","4.98 Stars, based on 11 feedbacks","Canada",NA,4.98,11

The programme runs for two years, and this survey was sent to our programme participants at the end of the two years, asking them about their experience of the programme as a whole . - Number of respondents and questions: There were 40 respondents to the survey, and each answered seven open-ended questions. Most of their answers are 1-3 sentences long. - Type of analysis: I am looking for someone to carry out a thematic analysis - coding responses to each question into themes, and providing a written description of each theme, including some illustrative quotes and a sense of how common/widespread/representative each theme is. Although the analysis needs to be high quality, our ultimate goal is to clearly and accurately understand what our participants are telling us, rather than scientific perfection in and of itself. Output: A short write-up of the themes under each question (e.g. in Microsoft Word), as described above. If it is possible to share details of the analysis too, that would be ideal (e.g. in Excel or an NVivo export) - but it's not a problem if this isn't possible. - Timelines: I am hoping to commission this project asap, so that it can be finished before starting the next project on 22nd July.

The buy or sell orders are sent out to be executed in the market when a certain set of criteria is met. What Is a Bear Call Spread? Bear Call Spread Diagram Source: TheOptionsGuide.com A bear call spread—also known as a credit call spread—is a bearish options strategy that creates a net cash inflow at the onset. By purchasing a long call option and writing a short call option at a lower strike price, the strategy generates an immediate income with a limited gain and loss profile. The limited-risk, limited-reward strategy is ideal in situations where traders are cautiously pessimistic. The strategies key prices to remember include: Maximum Gain – The maximum gain occurs when the stock price falls below both call option strike prices, which results in both options expiring worthless and the initial credit encompassing the profit. Maximum Loss – The maximum loss occurs when the stock price moves above the higher strike price, which results in a loss equal to the difference between the two strike prices minus the net credit received. Breakeven Point – The breakeven point occurs when the stock price is above the lower strike price by the amount of the initial credit received, which would result in the long call expiring worthless and the short evening out. Bear Call Spread Example Suppose that a trader believes that a stock will fall after its earnings announcement, but he or she isn’t confident enough to short the stock outright or use simple put options. By simultaneously buying an SEP 50 call for $100 and selling an SEP 45 call for $300, the trader establishes a bear call spread and receives a net $200 credit for entering the trade – the difference between the two premiums. See also Understanding a Short-Squeeze and How to Profit From One If the stock falls to $44.00 at expiration, as expected following a poor earnings announcement, both options will expire worthless and the trader will keep the entire $200 net credit received at the onset as a profit. If the stock rises to $52.00 instead, both calls expire in the money and the trader will have to buy back the spread for $500, which translates to a $300 loss after the $200 credit. Bear Call Spread Dynamics The bear call spread strategy is ideal in situations where traders are cautiously pessimistic given its limits on profit and loss potential, but there are many different ways to make the strategy profitable in different situations. For example, traders can enter a more aggressive bear call spread by expanding the difference between the two strike prices. These dynamics will increase the initial credit received and thereby the maximum profit potential, although the stock price must move down to a greater degree in order to realize that profit, which introduces more risk on the part of the position as a whole. The Bottom Line The bear call spread strategy is a bearish strategy that’s optimal for traders predicting a moderate decline in price. With its controlled profit and loss profile, traders know exactly how much they can gain or lose on the trade, which sets it apart from riskier strategies like naked puts or short selling. The other key benefit is that the credit is realized upfront and can be reinvested in other trades. less",NA,NA,"$10k+ ","4.91 Stars, based on 81 feedbacks","United States",NA,4.91,81

Also collected demographics, health history, and Chinese medicine diagnosis, concomitant medication.

The sample size was intended to be 84 (allowing for 30% withdrawal rate) however only recruited 14 in the time-frame. Pathology tests and Chinese medicine diagnosis were conducted 3 times. Other data (hot flush data and quality of life, adverse events) was collected at baseline and every 4 weeks (Baseline, Week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33) i.e. 10 times.

Cross-over mean daily hot flush frequency, severity and score compared within individuals used paired t-tests among those completing 12 weeks and 28 weeks. Additionally mixed linear analysis to test within-person treatment effect (intervention vs placebo) adjusted for the sequence effect, period effect and the 2 baseline measures to reduce biases (carry over effect).

We need to add release_window to every date or NULL for pre-releases/ sparse screenings. Requirements: * A movie release is defined as any range of dates with one or more dates having more than 100 showtimes. * A movie release cut-off is any date with less than 5% of the maximum showtimes within that movie release. * Regardless of the number of count, dates with movie showtimes 30 days after the end of the last release window are ignored.

You can see how the data will be gathered in the attached spreadsheet. It is preferable, if you have some knowledge about SEO. The purpose of this correlations study is to find some correlations that should be used for understanding Amazon's algorithm. An example of a correlation that has been found, could be following: - The 1st organic search result has the keyword mentioned 10 times - Has in average 1k reviews - Has the keyword mentioned 10 times - The keyword is in always in the title of the 1st result - The average price for 1st result product is 20$ - and 1st and 3th quartiles Furthermore, please split up the correlation into general correlations (ex. number of words correlates positive/negative with number of pictures) and into specific based on the best ranking product. Example: #1st ranking product (keyword organic search number, 1) correlates positive/negative with Keyword in title. It may be difficult to know which correlations to look for, if you have no SEO experience or knowledge. If you have knowledge about SEO, you will also know that: ""The product that ranks 48th on a given search does not have the keyword in the title"" is relevant and ""Number of words correlates with the keyword's presence in the review section"" is not relevant. Another example of a relevant correlation: The worst ranking product has 1200 words in the description and the keyword mentioned 10 times, whereas the best ranking product only have 400 words and the keyword mentioned 2 times. I think the best results will in relevant cases be found by using smaller parts of the data set to find correlations. Example: Products from the keyword category - ""office supplies"": The correlation for amount of keywords in title and their ranking is positive/negative. Another thing, which I think we could be able to find: Keywords with 3 words in it has a correlation close to 1.00 with the keyword in the title. This is also something that is exciting to find.

Sometimes our scanning team misses areas, sometimes the data quality is bad. We want to know which areas we missed and which areas have we captured. I have a video explaining the process in full detail: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k5qvwzto43carz5/QGIS%20How%20to%20extract%20missing%20area%20maps.mov?dl=0 You will need the following tools for the operation: • QGIS with Spatialite and GeoTIFF support • Dropbox and a Dropbox account – we’ll be sharing files through Dropbox. For each building we will make available to you: • 6-band GeoTIFF files in which band 5 contains the captured point count the given floor that we will base our analysis on. • Spatialite databases that have been created from auto-converting CAD files. • A (logarithmic) color ramp configuration to apply as style for the GeoTIFF files. You will execute the following tasks (as explained in training videos) for each building (we will call it a “batch”): 1. You will create a QGIS project file You will execute the following tasks for each floor in the building: 2. You will create a layer group identifying the floor. As floor label you should use the same labels of the GeoTIFF file. The GeoTIFF files are named as follows: {Building-ID}_{Substructure-ID}_{Floor-Level-ID}.tiff 3. You will load the GeoTIFF file and assign the “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection in meters. You will apply the color ramp as a style as shown in the video. 4. You will load the Spatialite database and assign the “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator mm” projection (in millimeters). You will enable or disable vector layers until you got a good view. 5. You will create a new POLYGON layer in the Spatialite database (in “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection) called “missing” and mark up all areas missing (white) the the GeoTIFF file. Ignore crossed areas in the Spatialite layers and other areas explained to be excluded in the video. Each area gets a “label” field using the following naming scheme: {Building-ID} {Substruction-ID} L-{Floor-Level-ID} missing {running number} The running number is to be increased for each missing area marked up. The style should be backwards hashed and the label should be clearly visible on the map. 6. You will create a new POLYGON layer in the Spatialite database (in “Arbitrary Transverse Mercator m” projection) called “captured” and mark up the area that have been captured. Please be intelligent about it: You don’t need to create inner rings to markup holes and if the GeoTIFF ends close to Spatialite line vectors, use point snapping. The style should be forward hashed. 7. You will create a new “print layout” (paper format: A4 landscape) that displays the “missing areas” of this floor as shown in the video. Do not include the “captured” layer in the PDF. Each print layout should contain the following label on top of the page: {Building-ID} {Substructure-ID} L-{Floor-ID} You will save the print layout as PDF under the same name as the label above. The purpose of this PDF is: I want to give the map to my scanning team, so they know which areas they have to capture again. The missing area labels must be easily readable, so when I talk to them we can refer to specific areas by their label. Deliverables: • QGIS project file • “captured” and “missing” layers in each floor’s Spatialite database. • PDF file for each floor showing missing areas (like in the video). All deliverables will be shared through Dropbox or in rare cases through upwork file upload. We are hiring multiple freelancers for the job. We will be giving each one of you initially a small sample. The better the quality and the speed of your work, the more work we will assign to you from our backlog. In your application to this job, please specify: • How long have you worked with QGIS software? Do you have any question about what was shown in the video? • Have you worked with point-clouds before? How? What software were you using? Freelancers and agencies who do not answer the questions above in their application will be silently ignored. Please go through the training materials and share with me your questions. If you don’t have any question, I will assign you the first batch as a paid trial run. Please provide me with the following details to set up up for the job: • The email address for your Dropbox account. I will be sharing a folder with you for each registration job that you work on. • Which version of QGIS are you intending to use?

We have a number of client dashboards that are updated either directly from the data source (Analytics, Ads) and we set most of that up. Many of our dashboards are more complex than that. These require us to get data into a G Sheet and then flows into a Data Studio Template. We use Supermetrics as the connector in G Sheets, where we bring in daily data from a number of sources, do some processing in G Sheets, and then offer it to our clients usually through Data Studio Templates. We have an immediate need to find an application data developer who is familiar with G Sheets, App Script, and Supermetrics (although that's pretty easy to learn). We'd also like to find someone who has Biq Query experience, and can eventually help us connect our G Sheets applications to Big Query tables, off loading some processing time (and big data). Right now we have several dashboards that are breaking ... aren't updating from Supermetrics ... which happens far too frequently (haha), but that's the way it goes. So, initially your work will be about fixing those problems as they arise. You will also start helping all our clients (and new clients) getting set up on our dashboard system, and eventually deeper programming in Big Query once you understand how we approach things. This is part-time, piecemeal work that we will assign to you, for which you'll be paid hourly. We are looking for a flexible individual (NOT AN AGENCY!) for a long-term relationship where you are one of the people who are on a team serving clients. All work you do must be done with Upwork, recording your screen as you work. You will be paid through Upwork as well. Some communication may occur out of the platform (such as email). To apply for the position, you must have experience with data skills & G Suite, especially G Sheets (i.e. prior projects) as well as being able to demonstrate privacy as you'll be trusted with client data. Once we select the successful applicant, we will communicate your first task to see how you do (it's a Google MyBusiness Data Studio Template Dashboard that has already been set up and working with an existing G Sheet; supermetrics stopped collecting data a few weeks back.)

We are also interested in where applications to certain lenders fall in a sequence, and whether that application was made in isolation, or as part of a cluster of applications. Background: Our service connects users with various lending options based on their profile. The average number of applications per user is approximately 1.6, which has a skewed distribution to a long tail that can stretch to 10 or more applications. A user will sometimes apply to several options in 1 single sessions, and sometimes can wait several months before applying again. We are trying to gain insights from the order and time differences in which the applications are made to ascertain if certain lending options should be presented at different times, or not at all. ‘Success’ for our business is measured in Transactions, ie: the application leads to an approval and there is commission earned. The magnitude of the commission is secondary to whether there is a commission at all. Data Fields: ApplicationID - integer string - unique for each application UserID - integer string - unique for each user StatusID - numerical code for status of the application, which is one of 6 possible codes. User Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the user joined the platform Application Created Date - Date and time stamp - when the application was created Year, Month, Day, Weekday, Week# - simple breakdown of Application Created Date into components LenderID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each lender PartnerID - integer string - unique numerical identifier for each affiliate partner Credit Score ID - numerical indicator (from 1 to 5) denoting the user’s credit score band (eg: Fair, Good, Excellent etc.) Transaction Value - currency string - value of the commission arising from an application, if any. Transaction Date - when the transaction occurred App. Rec. - if the application was created during the month-end reconciliation process.

Each unit is scored for quality. (Product score) This score ranges from 0.01 to 30. We then separate and package these products into the 5 different sorts (or grades) Each sort has a different market value. Sort 5 is the most valuable and Sort 1 the least valuable Some products are eligible to be placed in any of the 5 categories. Obviously, we would like the to separate the products so that the overall mix of sorts is the most valuable. However, as a population, each sort must satisfy two requirements. The Average Product Score for that product must meet a minimum criteria and the 5%ile score for that product must meet a minimum criteria. If you move a product from one category to another, it changes the average and 5%ile property for both categories. We know the distribution of the Product scores before we undertake the sorting process. (Think of it like a bucket of marbles and we know the Product score of each of the marbles before we sort them) We are looking for a programmer to write code that calculates the optimum sorting set-points for each of the sorts that maximizes the value whilst meeting the minimum value Average Product Score for each sort and the minimum value 5%ile Product Score for each sort. A functional specification is attached. A run time limit for running the code is not specified, as we would like to discuss the trade off between optimisation time and run time. Budget amount is set as minimum. Happy to discuss costs. less",NA,NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Australia",NA,NA,NA
