The current live version (www.Hopperhq.com/blog/instagramrichlist) is for 2018. We would like to add new ranking pages for the Influencer’s 2019 data.

Currently influencer posts have the ranks set as post meta data. We would like them to be set dynamically based on the post meta cost_per_post. We'd also like a method of creating autonomously custom images showing the influencer and their core data overlays with HTML, for the purpose of visitors sharing these on social media.

The reason we are need this literature sheet is that it isn't possible to print all of the details from the listing via the web interface. Content: Probably somewhere near the top of the sheet, we want the red AirBnB logo & text ""AirBnB"" - showing that this is from our listing. The text & photos should come from the AirBnB listing (copy paste the text, right click each image to download locally for the project). https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33450347?s=67&shared_item_type=1&virality_entry_point=1&sharer_id=252000524 Note: You don't need to include every image you see in the listing, a representative sample would be fine. For instance, you probably don't need to include the images of the Keurig instant coffee cups, TV screen showing Roku Guest login, snow covered tractor. Mostly we want to emphasize the outside house image, plus the inside images of the rooms (and you will notice there are multiple pictures of each room, so you can pick the best representative images). Logo - We have a logo image which can be used (01964_n_17apucw9ez2485_Drovers_Trail_Logo.jpg), probably in a small contact area on the sheet.

I also want someone who is looking for a long-term gig. Also, maybe you are tired of ghostwriting and want to be published on your own? I'm open to that too.

Don’t leave us hanging without a word from you. -If a second and third draft are required, we will expect it. We don’t stop until a book 110%. We do pay for this though. Usually we will pay for these drafts by the hour. All rates are negotiable. -A phone interview and signing a contract/NDA are required. Lastly, submit your current rates for writing a first draft and also include your hourly rate for second and third drafts. NOTE: Please do this exactly as asked. Please send me the first three chapters from your best contemporary romance. Also, send a steamy scene as well. If you don't send exactly that, we won’t consider you for this position.

Each Folder in Jenkins will have different and multiple Jobs (For example folder Jenkins-A-Folder has jobs name (i) jobDocker, (ii) jobAPI, (iii) jobDeploy and (iv) jobBuild) -- Details on Grafana Dashboard. -- To explain in detail, Grafana Dashboard should correspond to one Jenkins Folder. Each individual Dashboard in Grafana should display data only for one particular Jenkins folder. The data in each Grafana Dashboard should correspond to ONE Jenkins Folder and the jobs inside that Jenkins Folder only.

A very similar website to what I’m trying to create is Deliveroo: https://deliveroo.co.uk. The only difference will be the colors in the background. Plus, in the area where the food is depicted, I would like the two icons to be displayed (Download in iOS and Download in Android; the links to these apps will be provided by me afterwards, I would just need you to create these icons). Also, please keep in mind that on the top right corner, I would like only 2 fields (Log in/Sign Up as an Owner and Log in/Sign Up as a Customer). Upon choosing on one of the above there will be two forms to fill either Login or Sign Up. Also, I have created a MySQL database which will communicate with the website. This website will be published in a LAMP stack server so the database should be the latest version of MySQL and the site’s configuration should be LAMP compatible. The website will be written in HTML, CSS, PHP. Kiosk Owner Log in/Sign Up: 1. Update My Kiosk 2. Accept/Decline Orders Upon logging in as a business owner, a UI will provide access only to a certain part of the DB (Products_Kiosks table) where the owner will be able to add his/her available products found in the database’s master-list. The master-list will have for instance 600 products, but that particular kiosk has only 350 of them. In addition to that, after successful login as an owner he/she will be able to accept or decline orders. Upon accepting or declining an order, the client should be notified at that given time if the order has been declined or accepted. After that an email will be sent to the customer with approximate arrival time confirmation code etc. Also, the approximate time is exact for a given kiosk let’s say for kiosk 1 the delivery time is 20 min for 25 min etc. Customer Log in/Sign Up: When the customer clicks to Log in, he may log in with social media accounts, Google or email and password. Upon login as a customer, he/she will be displayed the following model: A field that displays all the available addresses that you have associated with that account or if you want to add a new one. After that there will be a button to Order. Upon clicking on the button order: Choose Kiosk - Categories – SubCategories – SubSubCategories – Products. For example, Tobacco – Filters – Rizla – Rizla Green. In the Products menu there will be a return button that will go 1 option back. Also, before the customer chooses a kiosk next to the kiosk there will be the following fields: Delivery Time, Minimum Order, If the Store supports Cards or Cash only, Ratings. (Consider that the kiosks displayed will be the ones available near him and not everything. Each kiosk will provide its’ delivery range). Upon choosing a certain kiosk only the products that certain kiosk has will be displayed. Upon choosing a certain product there will be a new menu opening that the customer will be able to add comments add or remove quantity and a button to add to the card. Also, in the header of this new menu the title of the product and the price will be displayed. When the customer reaches the basket to complete the order there will be a summary of the address, name, phone number, block to add a comment, payment method, Cash, Credit/Debit or PayPal and then a button to send the order. When the customer selects Credit/Debit or PayPal there will be a button to add a new card but also the available cards he/she has added to the account must be displayed, if there are none a requirement will be to add a new card. Same’s applies for PayPal. App An iOS app with the exact functionality as the website apart from the business owner. The app is intended to work only for the customer. Everything above after the Customer Log in/Sign Up Button. You will be provided with 2 websites and apps that are identical to this project and I will go through both of them via video call with you to ensure we are in the right direction. Also, if I like your work you will be given the Android App as well.

This project gives us an opportunity to see how we work together and to see the impressive calibre of your work! Once we have completed this email series/project, an additional project would be for you to then create new emails which can be split tested against the original ones, meaning that there will be plenty more work in the coming weeks! To apply, please answer the following questions and submit the required example: Questions - - Have you used ActiveCampaign before? If so, are you comfortable setting up an automation series? - Are you comfortable in designing emails that look good? If so, can you please provide an example? - How many emails would be in the 30 day campaign? - How long (days) would the post purchase email campaign series be? And how many emails would there be in the series? What price would you charge for full project (creation and implementation of the full series of emails for the campaign and post campaign)? - Please can you provide links to any examples of emails that you’ve created?

The actual cleaning of the data is simple but in process it takes a lot of time because a person might have to do this work 20-40 times in a week. What I’d like to do is build a process that handles the transformation work in a more automated fashion and limits the amount of manual cleansing as much as possible. Conceptually, I think this consists of: - Read a file - Rename and reorganize columns based on a map or regex - Generate columns based on filename and date - Append to an existing file - Log filename, date, to a separate log In an ideal state this process would also either move files from one location to another or loop through all files in a folder and skip those that have already been processed before. I know that all of this could be done using RapidMiner (which I use a little) or other programs but I’d like this to be something that is relatively easy for us to run and access without a data science background. less","ETL Pipelines",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","United States",NA,NA,NA
