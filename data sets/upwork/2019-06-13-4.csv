The paper is about Krippendorff's alpha for the reliability of unitizing textual continua. Here are more details: I am a linguist working on a language project in which I have two annotators to identify noun phrases in natural texts. For example, given these three 'dummy' sentences: 1) I was the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop. 2) I didn't believe her. Annotator 1 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe her. Annotator 2 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl] with [blue eyes] in [the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe [her]. The differences between the two annotators are due to (1) not applying the maximal principle according to which all elements modifying the head noun need to be tagged within the same NP span, and (2) not considering a particular chunk as a NP. The two annotators are done doing their jobs and now I need to know how reliable the annotations are. I looked in the literature and I found out about Krippendorff's alpha for text unitization (paper attached). The attached paper is the last development of the measure. However, the paper looks like hieroglyphics to me. Therefore, what I need someone with a good background in data analysis, inter-annotator agreement, computational linguistics, and/or natural language processing to explain it to me in simple English, apply it (even roughly manual) to my dummy examples, and answer my questions like: 1. I don't have categories. How can I apply alpha then? 2. How to compute units with perfect beginning and ends but with gaps in between? 3. Which alpha best suits my data? I need to understand the paper well before I decide my next step: whether to use their software, hire a programmer to implement the formulas for me, or just skip this measure and look for another. Notes: 1. Please take a good look into the paper :) This is crucial. 2. This is the latest version of the measure. Earlier, and simpler, versions are here: - (2004) https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=asc_papers - (2013) http://web.asc.upenn.edu/usr/krippendorff/m-Replacement%20of%20section%2012.4%20on%20unitizing%20continua%20in%20CA,%203rd%20ed.pdf less","Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, ",NA,"$2k+ ","4.76 Stars, based on 33 feedbacks","Egypt",NA,4.76,33
