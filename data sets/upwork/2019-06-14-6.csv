If the page is not valid (ie, it is not appropriate to ask for a link on the page to my website) - mark it as 'Not Valid.' I will pay you $1 for every email you find (I will be checking accuracy of the emails you submit). I just need you to try and find the right email.

You can also use site queries in Google to try and find the webmaster, such as ""site:example.com webmaster"" or “example.com contact” 7. When you find the email, record the email address into the textbox underneath the URL back on the Sitedial page (please note, we use email validation to determine is an email exists & is active, so if the email does not exist - you will be flagged to try another email) 5.
