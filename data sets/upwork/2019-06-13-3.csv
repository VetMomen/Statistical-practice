The exact instructions (which I will provide upon hire) are also listyed at the bottom of this post. I will provide the website I am asking them to link to in the web-based interface. If the page is not valid (ie, it is not appropriate to ask for a link on the page to my website) - mark it as 'Not Valid.' I will pay you $1 for every email you find (I will be checking accuracy of the emails you submit). I just need you to try and find the right email. I will also pay $0.10 for every page you mark as 'Not Valid' since this task typically takes a small fraction of the time to determine if the page isn't valid. See attached screenshot of the web-based interface that I will provide to you. You will have a login and can do this work anytime you'd like. I keep track of statistics like how many emails you've completed per week so you know how much to bill me for. For example, if the URL I give you is this: https://www2.ewu.edu/cstem/departments/mathematics/math-degrees/careers-in-mathematics Then you would provide me the email 'mgrant@ewu.edu' (you can see it listed at the bottom-left of the page) because that is the faculty member who maintains it. You should NOT provide me a boilerplate webmaster email for wustl.edu. I want the specific email for the specific person that maintains that specific page or group of pages. I can afford to pay up to $500 per week ($2,000 per month) to start with, and can either increase or decrease volume based on the results of what you give me. EXACT INSTRUCTIONS: 2. Navigate (left click) to each url that you are presented with 3. If no email exists, the URL does not work, or the page is not in English, then click 'Not Valid' - otherwise, proceed to step 4. 4. Determine whether or not this page is appropriate to ask for a link to be placed on it to my site (you have this information in your main 'list' page). If it's not relevant to ask for a link on, then go back to the Sitedial window, and click 'Not Valid.' If the URL is relevant to ask for a link to be placed going back to my site, then proceed to step 5. 5. Visit the URL and click around the website if needed to find the email address of the person that would update and add a link to the specific webpage, or - if unavailable - the website's general webmaster. If neither of those is present, try and find a general contact email for the site, and if that is also not present, 6. You can also use site queries in Google to try and find the webmaster, such as ""site:example.com webmaster"" or “example.com contact” 7. When you find the email, record the email address into the textbox underneath the URL back on the Sitedial page (please note, we use email validation to determine is an email exists & is active, so if the email does not exist - you will be flagged to try another email) 5. If no email exists, and you cannot find it, simply leave the box blank click 'Not Found' Thank you! less","Link Building, SEO Backlinks, Data Entry,  ",NA,"$20k+ ","4.96 Stars, based on 39 feedbacks","United States",NA,"4.96","39"

The aim here to run CHAID model on continuous predictors. CHAID decision tree model basically select the predictor that is most significant and then split it into nodes based on significant level. Accordingly it will take predictor and test each one against the predictor variable. We can use Python CHAID package, however we might also need to evaluate other available decision trees package if python CHAID package will not give a valid result. (The SPSS output will be provided for comparison if needed). Data has 5 continuous target variables -- dependent variable and I would like to run CHAID decision tree for each separately to find most significant predictor variables.

The website will allow users to sign up and create their own interactive sporting league that will allow them and all their friends who join the league to input their statistics when they complete a round regarldess of where in the world they are. Each player can add their own scores and stats and then complete with others around the world in their league. Further details: The structure: Pages 1. Sign in/Sign up (this will be the homepage, so it's very simple) 2. Profile page (profile info, join and create a league). You will also be able to see all the leagues you are in. As you could be in multiple leagues. 3. League page. (something like this - http://alchemists-wp.dan-fisher.com/soccer/team/alchemists/) 4. Billing & payment page. 5. Page about player. What should be included on the league page? - A league table - Past Winners - Although this will be blank to begin with - Various Stats - any that we could include . E.g. player average score, best round, worst round. - Player Updates/Log - as someone enters a score it says ""John Deer has just scored 36 points at..."" (this on the right-hand side of the example page and I assume is built into the plugin) As we allow people to enter more stats we can increase the stats that are shown but to begin with I think that's all that's needed. Users must be able to easily add their scores and the leagues automatically updates. Personalisation of the league - Option to specify how many rounds for that league. This can be a fixed number of rounds each, or it can be time-based until a certain date where the best 10 scores are counted etc. Inclusion of Major Events - not essential but if we could do this would be great. The league organise can set certain dates as a ‘major’. One round you get an extra point for these rounds... adds a bit of pressure. Also if they have actual in person competitions - like a big tournament, I would like them to able to add the winner to the stats.

This is the Site Map and Flow, we will deliver it finished with every detail: https://app.flowmapp.com/share/4dcae973ed31585745281ef9dd5246e2/sitemap/ A similar service could be distrokid.com We are looking for someone who can provide a fast and comprehensive solution to our needs and that can take the lead proposing and approaching our ideas rather than we telling exactly how to do them. We already have a UI and Front-end designer. We need a Front/Back-end developer that can design a robust database and make API integrations. We have a very well streamlined sketch and structure of how the site should work, but we need someone to make it happen while making suggestions from their experience. You should be creative, respectful, responsable and fast, and be available to start working asap. We’d like you to make a full project budget, we can add more to the budget if it's needed. Here is a basic summary, if you are interested we can talk about the details and give you further information: -Landing: our designer is working on it now. -Ecommerce with subscription model, with different payment gateways (MercadoPago for starters but with the possibility to add more) and the possibility to change between Plans. It should keep track of the due dates, confirm payments, do automatic emailing. Users can be: ///Client(different Plans)/Profesional/Venue/ ///Admin/Support/Operator/Sales. -Unless you have a better suggestion, what we have in mind is a main Dashboard including all Pages that are filtered by type of User, where the Admin can see and edit all of them, including the content/labels displayed, so that it can be self-maintained and updated. -Different Client Plans/User Categories have different permissions and capabilities. -User Dashboard with Support/Releases/Royalties/Statistics/My Profile/Account Settings/ pages. -Admin Dashboard with different Categories (Support/Releases/Royalties/Sales) of Tasks assigned per User Type (Admin/Chief Operator/Operator/Support), it could integrate or work like a board similar to Trello. The admin can generate and assign tasks to other Users. -Support Area with FAQ, tickets, Zendesk or something similar (we'd appreciate your recommendation). -Automatic email rendering and composing for some Tasks that require emailing with our providers and with our costumers. The ability to keep organized record of the email conversations per client and with our provider, as it should replace our Gmail or integrated with it. -Each Client has the ability to upload Music Releases (form + assets) that are saved on our own database and, once approved by our Admin, sent to our provider through their API. Once approved, the client Dashboard displays the API collected data, our database serves as a mirror and backup of what we send to our providers. This should be future proof, as if we ever change provider. -Secure Database for the data and files submitted by our clients and their account information. (We should migrate our existing User database from our old Wordpress site) -API integration with our provider (it should retrieve information specific for each user and display it in their dashboard and submit Database entries to their platform, after Admin approval) -The site should be able to open a global .csv Royalties Report uploaded manually by us every month, format it, and compile it filtered by User. Then make it to downloadable to them in their Dashboard. The site should keep track of Total Royalties earned and Royalties already paid per Clients. -Blog with the ability to create/edit/upload articles. Second Stage: -Once submited by the User and approved by an Admin, My Profile generates a unique site per User, with a user.ourdomain.com domain, it is based on a generic Template. -Compile a Google Map's type map on the location of our Users, filtered by User category.

The data will be extracted from finance.yahoo.com (under Historical Data when getting a stock quote). I will plot the efficient frontier for the pair of stocks and determine the minimum variance portfolio of the two, as will, this calculation going to be repeated for other four pairs of stocks (e.g., high correlation, low correlation, negative correlation, etc.). Then I will give a brief explanation for why the most highly correlated pair have such a correlation (e.g., related to their business activities), and similarly for the pair with the least correlation. Then, I'm going to explore an additional of risk-free assets, and what conclusion can be draw in relation to one of portfolios from what we discussed in classes. For the 10 stocks together using 2 years of daily data I am going to estimate the covariance and find sets of portfolio weights that maximize return, minimize risk, and maximize the Sharpe ratio. As will for the cases when short-selling is allowed and is not allowed and write a discussion of the results. The fundamental goal of portfolio theory is to optimally allocate the investments between different assets. Mean variance optimization (MVO) is a quantitative tool that will allow us to make this allocation by considering the trade-off between risk and return. In conventional single period (MVO), I will make the portfolio allocation for a single upcoming period, and the goal will be to maximize the expected return subject to a selected level of risk. Single period (MVO) was developed in the pioneering work of Markowitz. The single period Markowitz algorithm solves the following problem: Inputs: o The expected return for each asset o The standard deviation of each asset (a measure of risk) o The correlation matrix between these assets Output: o The efficient frontier, i.e. the set of portfolios with expected return greater than any other with the same or lesser risk, and lesser risk than any other with the same or greater return. The efficient frontier is conventionally plotted on a graph with the standard deviation (risk) on the horizontal axis, and the expected return on the vertical axis. The basic principles of balancing risk and return may already be appreciated in a two-asset portfolio. less","Mathematics, Presentations, Statistics, Financial Reports,  ",NA,"$400 ","4.99 Stars, based on 4 feedbacks","Canada",NA,"4.99","4"

I need to be able to collect donations, sell products (3 at most), and post pictures with stories of charity projects. My main page will look like a kid’s book, see attached. There will be 6 sections in this website: Logo - Where it says “Logo” place logo and write the name of the charity “Stella’s House, Inc”. Contact - That’s where I want to include my contact information with logo. Our Projects - That’s where I want to include my past projects with pictures and make it look like blogging. There should be about 10 different projects on the website. Each with some description and photos that will be supplied. Cat & Dog Rescue - That’s where I want to include information about stray dogs in Moldova such as statistics and all the help that is needed. Also, on this page, I want to create profiles of dogs that are available for adoption where I can include pics and videos of dogs and a little description. I want to be able to post as many as 15 dogs. The main cat and dog rescue page will show an overview and statistics and then it will show multiple photos with brief description of each animal available for adoption. There will not be a separate page for each animal. Everything will be on one page. Donate via Venmo, PayPal and Quick Pay with Zelle - That’s where I want to link charity bank account and have people make donations. When sponsors make donations, I want to be able to collect their name, email, phone number (optional), address (optional), how they heard about us and what project do they want to support (optional), if they want to receive a tax deduction letter (yes or no), and if they have any questions or comments (optional). All the required info could be done over a form. Our Story - That’s where I want to post a personal story that will consist of a few paragraphs and pictures. This will be one page. Lastly, the website should be mobile friendly despite the format of the home page (looking like a book - please see attached file ""Websites Illustration""). Additionally, the website should be easily edited - for example, if I need to add a new project, add a new animal for an adaption, or change wording or some photographs throughout the site.

Our stack consists of: an AIRTABLE backend, ZAPIER, G-SUITE, PandaDoc, and a couple of PYTHON scripts that are 'scraping' tools designed to access online external databases that hold information on projects that need to hire our clients. Currently, we use an Airtable Form to overwrite non-changing data to send HTML Emails and create follow-ups and adhere somewhat to lax business rules. We need better views or ways of being able to work with the data we're collecting. Dashboards. We also have almost completed our new client onboarding process based on PandaDoc collecting data from new clients and having it populate Airtable, QBO, Google Drive, Etc. For internal project management, we use ASANA. We are working on a new invoicing and accounts payable system using DOCPARSER for processing of checks for account receivable and ZAPIER to follow business rules to pay out clients from the funds we receive. DOCPARSER instantly creates the proper entries in QBO including a BILL which our PLOOTO EFT system pays once it goes thru a human approval step. These modules are hosted on Google Sites. We love our ideas now we just want to properly execute them as one system. My budget is NOT massive. It's a real hurdle, so I'm hoping that the right person who knows the right package can take our processes and deliver us something that is less stressful to maintain and FIX. Basic deliverables to start are: 1. create a secure 'company website' so we can easily send out templated HTML VERY IMPORTANT emails to our clients using a form prepopulated with any data that already exists in the system. A set of business rules for follow-up must also be implemented. So someone who understands business process design will be invaluable. 2. create meaningful management reports and dashboards on the success of each of the project we compete for plus data on trends that our buyers are following. Also, I would love to be able to have the contribution of each client to out P/L avail on demand. 3. fix and enhance our client onboarding process. It's 80% there, I just have no time. And could use someone else's ideas on how to make it better. It would be great if we could design a secure portal for clients to upload new materials (demo materials, photos, etc.) to help us in our jobs. Also to give them self serve options for changing their statistical information/gaining access to YTD Earning and fees paid to us etc. 4. track opportunities coming to clients who may not be on our team. Developing an instant and aggressive push to have our clients considered for these opportunities (if they fit.) This is a business process that we can create to be triggered by a simple email parser and simple email templates and auto reminders to make phone calls. 5. redesign a commission calculator for our employees. Eventually, I'd like to move more of the responsibility of monthly commission reporting to my employees. I spend too many hours on it. 6. (Complex perhaps) a contract tracking system for TVC projects that need to be renewed and renegotiated before the term expires. This should track as much intelligence as possible and present us with actionable outputs. 7. other ideas your brilliant minds may have on items that can be made self-service or automated. Perhaps time off requests, or other HR functions? Or any cool plugins to whatever CRM system I'm sure I'm going to need. It would be great if you could find a way to SAVE me money on the many subscriptions services I have at the present time. I wish it were not the case but COST does play a significant factor here. So if this sounds interesting please sharpen your pencil and bring me the best value/rate you're able to. It's always so nice when a long-term relationship is formed, and that's what I'm looking for. We have a shared contact list of 8000 people, about 200 clients in Canada, LA and around the world. While we are a small lean operation, we're busier than most everybody. If all of our systems spoke to each other, that would be amazing and there is almost no end to the creative projects we could take on here. I t would be great if you could start soon, too! I'm wondering if PODIO is the answer? Let me know what you think? If interested, please send over a CV and tell me about your expertise (required) in the technologies that you feel this project needs to move to (or keep) and a short note about why you have interest in this job. I'd also be very interested in similar projects and successes you may have had as well as what you feel cost should be, ideally broken down into milestones for the initials 6 deliverables.

The attached images are examples of what others have done. I want to build something similar but have my own metrics in mind (e.g. price/volume changes over many different time intervals, basic statistical analysis of the price/volume data, comparison of price/volume data to a couple of benchmarks, etc). I had a developer build a program to pull in price/volume data from various exchanges. The data is coming to my server (AWS) every 5 minutes. The site/server is an AWS EC2 and the developer used MySQL + Python + Flask for the build. We were originally trying to push the data to Google-sheets but aborted that after considerable difficulty. I need someone to upgrade the current system so that it's easy to use. I'm looking for someone that is good with APIs, databases and web/app development. The plan is to upgrade this to a commercial grade website and/or mobile app later (separate, larger project). Tasks required (Milestones) 1. Check exchange API feeds for accuracy and efficiency, and figure out system in place for selecting which coins' data to pull via the APIs (what's in place is a bit confusing to me) ($100) 2. Data feed adjustments (see details in attached Word doc) ($250) - Remove feed from Cryptopia and ensure Binance, Bittrex, Okex and Huobi are working well - Price (BTC & USD) for 6-hr and 12-hr time-intervals for top 300 coins (from CoinMarketCap, based on market cap ranking) - Live update of market cap of each coin that is being pulled from exchanges (data from CMC) - Upgrade system to capture buy and sell volume (separately) for each selected coin/exchange (every 5 minutes) 3. Check that the existing CSV download function is working properly (easily downloads, data correct) and fix any issues ($100) 4. Build output table(s) for the feed of data on the site, configure the system to do the required analysis and build output pages/sections in visually appealing format (output formats are WIP but details are in the attached word doc). Some conditional formatting will be required. TBD ($650) 5. Upgrade the CMS to be more user-friendly, allow multiple users (admin & regular) and restrict some sections/controls to only admin (note: new account UN/PW created manually by admins) ($150) 6. Build easy/auto-archive system to export ""old"" data to online storage (e.g. GoogleDrive, preferably as CSV/excel files) and then easy way for the data to be deleted (ie. manually, by selecting the exchange and the dates of data to delete...admin only privilege) ($150) 7. Additional visualization improvements on the output sections (example: line graphs for various time periods using price data in the DB) ($400) **Note: The developer who helped build the current system may also be involved on this project and the milestones may be split.

The initiative aims to complement efforts currently underway to develop an official indicator framework for monitoring the SDGs. The Inter-agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) has identified 23 global indicators under SDG16’s 12 targets. It is intended that national statistical systems will eventually produce the majority of the data for these indicators. The UN Statistical System and other global organizations will then collate this official data at the global level. However, official data availability and coverage is currently limited and it may take years to develop the necessary capacities and collect data for official monitoring through official statistical systems. In the interim, we should draw on available data to help countries to begin monitoring SDG16. The SDG16DI, formed by a group of organizations with expertise in these areas, aims to fill this role. The initiative is an attempt to pull together data sets in an open format in order to track SDG16 and provide an easily accessible snapshot of the current situation, and eventually of progress, over time. To this end, we include both global and complementary indicators, presented with official and unofficial data. The process also seeks to identify potential challenges in data quality, availability, and coverage that need to be addressed. 2019 Global Report: • Web optimized version to be housed at SDG16report.org • Print version with 45-50 predicted number of pages • US Letter size format of report • Layout incorporates substantial text (roughly 20,000 words), photos and data visualizations Specific design elements: • A two-page spread of a side by side visual comparison of the data availability for only official data and official data and non-official data • 2-4 Visualization graphics per chapters (11 chapters) –in the form of graphs and charts, in quarter and half page sizes • Each target chapter and the executive summary will be written and designed in order to be pulled out as a standalone issue brief. There will be 11 chapters that each include their own visualizations of the data to aid in the reader’s comprehension. The target chapters will explore: what is the state of the world according to available data; what are key trends that the data show; what is the was the state of data coverage; how non-official data supports the implementation of the target; and key methodologies for the non-official data. Format: The report is planned as a printed and online resource. The online version will be made available as an interactive website, SDG16report.org, as well as a PDF for download. Scope of work and deliverables: The consultant will: • Provide at least two preliminary design options (for both the printable and online versions of the report) for SDG16DI to select from. • Once a full draft is designed, further feedback will be provided by SDG16DI. • Design the layout of the report, once a choice of formats has been made. • Develop a website design for the report. • Produce necessary data visualizations. Qualifications: The consultant will have: • Documented experience of graphic design, including data visualization. • Documented experience of designing similar reports. • Relevant project management experience. Desirable qualifications include: • Experience in the governance, human rights, justice, peacebuilding, and international development fields. • A solid understanding of data and indicators. • A solid understanding of the SDGs and SDG16 specifically. Budget: Please provide quotes of no more than $8,000. Final payment will only be made on satisfactory completion of deliverables. Timeline: The consultant’s terms will be until July 5, 2019, though early delivery is preferred. Application process: Please send a CV and 2 examples of work that demonstrate how you meet the requirements above to Ursala Knudsen-Latta (uknudsen-latta@saferworld.org.uk) by June 6, 2019.

The main functions of the EA are to find the right entry points and after the entry to close the orders with 1,5% profit. If the trade situation changes and the price is hitting the other way as expected the EA is supposed to open additional orders for both opened positions (max. 5 for each position).Every following opened position must have a difference of 2% between each additional orders. This is called hedging with grid elements. EA must analyze the price movement on each instrument to consider the trend direction. ( I would like to have suggestions from the developer ) Our EA must work only with GBPUSD/EURJPY, EURUSD/GBPJPY, EURGBP/USDJPY pairs. Only 1 pair will entry on trade at the same time. Which pair will entry, depends on correlation difference. One way is to use a correlation coefficient to determine how closely two instruments are related. In general, it's a good idea to focus on quantifiable data, such as &quot; I will enter a pairs trade when price ratio exceeds two standard deviations.&quot; Buy the underperformer and sell the overperformer. In practice, a pair transaction works as follows: at one time, we buy the undervalued currencies and sell the overvalued. If the assumption of the reunification of their prices is confirmed (which has been statistically proven), we collect the profit. It is irrelevant whether the profit is generated by the growth of the undervalued, a drop in the overvalued one, or any other combination of price fluctuations. What matters is that we collect our profit when the difference in prices is reduced. less","Foreign Exchange Trading, Internet Research,   ",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Germany",NA,NA,NA

Your writing must be well-researched, 100% original, educating, engaging and must provide high quality information and value. The final book will be a combination of your writing (12,000 words) and mine (3,000). Your research and writing will be on: - the physiological causes and effects of a particular allergy - key statistics - stories that highlight how badly people can be affected by this allergy day-to-day - potential negative affect of the pharmaceuticals used to treat this condition and its symptoms To implement the project you will be required to: • Sign a writing contract • Read and follow a written brief from me to get direction on the scope, audience, structure, topics, key content boundaries and tone of voice for the book. We can video chat too if needed for a briefing. • Do online research into the scientific facts relevant to the topic, capturing the references for citing at the end of the book. • Mostly re-write, drawing heavily on the information and facts that you collect online to give you source material. This will vastly accelerate the writing. However, what you write must be original and in your own words, you cannot simply copy/paste or plagiarise other content. Synthesis of ideas is fine of course. • Work to milestones/phases: sections of the book will be required for submission based on an agreed schedule • Produce the sections in Microsoft Word • Provide/suggest royalty free images throughout the book (evidence they are RF) • Make revisions to the manuscript based on my direction if you have gone off brief. You must: • Be a native English speaker or bilingual • Draft the book in informal ‘spoken’ English style rather than formal written English • Use British English grammar, style, punctuation and spelling • Be able to plan your time to stick to the timeline and budget • Stick with conveying meaningful information that is actionable. No padding out to fill the pages. This project will suit you if you: • have an interest in health • want to help lots of people who suffer with this particular allergy • have light and engaging writing style • are happy to work to deadlines • don’t like bulleted lists (like I clearly do!) In applying for this project then submit at least one of example of a manuscript you’ve have produced. I'd expect you to: • Proof read your work • Make a round or two of edits to correct errors, tone of voice or typos Payment - milestones 1. First chapter submitted - 10% 3.

Unfortunately I have a baby at home and work full time, so don't have time to do it, but I still want to help my friend out. That's why I'm turning to you talented people on UpWork. I'm looking for someone who can proofread and edit any significant spelling/grammar mistakes in this thesis. As it's related to computer science, much of it is statistics, formula and other non-written content that doesn't need to be proofread. I would estimate there around 15,000 words total that do need proofing/editing. Here are some exerts: The development and habitation of human have caused significant environmental issues. One of the most serious problems we are facing today is climate change that occurs when the climate system transforms into new weather patterns that the earth has not seen over the course of a hundred or million years. These changes might result in the altering of ecosystems, drastic temperature changes, lacking food and water supplies due to harsh weather, vegetation and animal extinction, etc. In order to prevent these threats from happening, besides reducing hazardous chemical substances to the environment, managing natural resources is a sustainable solution. In that respect, forestry - an applied science that studies forests and their ecosystem, plays an important role in attenuating the environmental impacts by significantly contributing to the world's carbon stock (estimated around 32.6 gigatonnes per year \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110512-135914}). As forests cover a third of the earth's surface and are distributed around the globe, managing the forests requires effective methods. In that regard, remote sensing is the only feasible approach as it allows foresters to keep track of large forest areas. --- The simplified version of gradient descent is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gradientDescentExp}. The gradient of $J$ at the point $\vw$ tells us how a small change in $\vw$ results in the change in $J$. If the gradient is positive, a small increase/decrease in the value of $\vw$ will lead to a small increase/decrease in the value of $J$. On the contrary, if the gradient is negative, a small increase/decrease in the value of $\vw$ will lead to a small decrease/increase in the value of $J$. Thus, moving towards the opposite direction or the descending direction of the gradient ensures a reduction in the value of $J$. This is why it is called gradient descent. In this example, the gradient (or the slope of the dashed black line) of $J$ associated with the initial weight $\vw$ is positive, thus reducing $\vw$ will make $J$ smaller. -- Anything that looks oddly formatted should be left alone - the thesis is actually written in a statistics based software, so parts will appear strangely in Word or a standard text editor.

After the building mask is extracted from the satellite image via semantic segmentation, the building shape is often irregular. The objective is to regularise the building shapes via the algorithm developed. The algorithm should take care of only the regularisation/polygonisation part. The segmentation part is already completed. The algorithm has to be developed in Python and should not use any paid API calls. The solution may use the polyline compression algorithm to correct distortions in building footprint polygons created through semantic segmentation that may produce undesirable artifacts. The developed solution should not use standard approaches, e.g. the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which are greedy in nature. The solution may use some priori building properties, which can be manually set. Some properties for example can be: 1. The building edge must be of at least some length, both relative and absolute, e.g. 3 meters 2. Consecutive edge angles are likely to be 90 degrees 3. Consecutive angles cannot be very sharp, smaller by some auto-tuned threshold, e.g. 30 degrees 4. Building angles likely have very few dominant angles, meaning all building edges are forming an angle of (dominant angle ± n?/2) To summarise, the solution can follow any logic to output regularised polygons with min no of vertices. The regularisation process should take less than a sec for each polygon., in total for a large area with 10,000 polygons, the process should not take more than few mins. At the time of bidding, kindly explain your algorithm in brief (just the building blocks so that I get a rough idea where we are headed). For solution acceptance, a processed mask (building footprint) will be shared as a numpy file and you will have to share the corresponding regularised mask along with time statistics. less","Python, Algorithms, Geographic Information System (GIS, ",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","India",NA,NA,NA

Coupled with the overall statistics of how difficult it is to find the real top salespeople and how the challenge is, in today's environment, you can't continue recruiting salespeople the way W. Clement Stone used to do it 50 years ago. The consumer's world has changed forever from what it was just 20 years ago. The strength of the media business is their tremendous sales culture. And the fact is, great salesmanship can position itself as being the consumer's friend.

The paper is about Krippendorff's alpha for the reliability of unitizing textual continua. Here are more details: I am a linguist working on a language project in which I have two annotators to identify noun phrases in natural texts. For example, given these three 'dummy' sentences: 1) I was the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop. 2) I didn't believe her. Annotator 1 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl with blue eyes in the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe her. Annotator 2 yields: 1) [I] was [the only girl] with [blue eyes] in [the workshop]. 2) [I] didn't believe [her]. The differences between the two annotators are due to (1) not applying the maximal principle according to which all elements modifying the head noun need to be tagged within the same NP span, and (2) not considering a particular chunk as a NP. The two annotators are done doing their jobs and now I need to know how reliable the annotations are. I looked in the literature and I found out about Krippendorff's alpha for text unitization (paper attached). The attached paper is the last development of the measure. However, the paper looks like hieroglyphics to me. Therefore, what I need someone with a good background in data analysis, inter-annotator agreement, computational linguistics, and/or natural language processing to explain it to me in simple English, apply it (even roughly manual) to my dummy examples, and answer my questions like: 1. I don't have categories. How can I apply alpha then? 2. How to compute units with perfect beginning and ends but with gaps in between? 3. Which alpha best suits my data? I need to understand the paper well before I decide my next step: whether to use their software, hire a programmer to implement the formulas for me, or just skip this measure and look for another. Notes: 1. Please take a good look into the paper :) This is crucial. 2. This is the latest version of the measure.

We need someone with a touch of expertise in the mentioned technologies and someone who can deliver us our work in a short period of time. This is a half-baked project and is more than completed, but needs tweaking and someone who can complete the non-existing code. We are a startup and have a limited scope of the budget for this work. The details are as follows: Our product has two frontends: one mobile app and one is a web dashboard. The web dashboard is used by merchants and the app is used by consumers. The product is called point-of-interaction-system, and it exactly does that. It interacts with users via a mobile application. The app is based on a Bluetooth stack and detects the presence of a customer inside a proximity zone. The app communicates with the backend to notify the user’s presence which is then shown on a web-dashboard. The web-dashboard is used by merchants for other mainstream purposes too, like billing, ordering, history management, etc. We have multiple use-cases, but the current one if focus on a cafe/restaurant where a user walks inside a store, and orders something from within the mobile app, or by directly interacting with the merchant. There are three types of users - pois app users, non-app users, john-doe users (who won’t give any data). Non-app users are identified by manual billing on their cellphones. We need a backend developer to complete the product which is currently half-baked and is almost 50% complete. - Use-case of the app: Reward Generation, Ordering and Interactions, Payment Management and Generation. - Use-case of web dashboard: Used by merchants to accept orders from apps, normal (non-app) order generation, data-collection-management, statistics, etc. Out of this, the 50% scope is completed. We need someone who can understand our current code and finish the feature list. A descriptive list of APIs can be seen in this given link here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12YVKWnYff0kCiibYl_JQOmVDXOpMMljMAIIYxjlQ848/ You need to work on the incomplete APIs and the required optimisations and configurations.

Our preferred framework is Drupal or Django. However, if you are skilled in an alternative platform and you put forth a great proposal you'll be given the project. The basic idea is that buyers (recruiters) will post projects (jobs) while sellers (workers) bid for the projects, work, and get paid. . For simplicity, all jobs will be fixed rate - no hourly jobs and job tracking features. The main features are: 1. Both seller and buyer should be able to rate each other and add comments. 2. Seller's profile page displays his/her work history (statistics) such as total money earned, number of jobs completed, average rating. Where applicable, these stats should be given for “last six months”, “last one year” and “all-time”. 3. When a seller receives payment for work done a commission is paid to the website owner. 4. The payment mechanism should allow buyers to pay by milestones (i.e. a project can be divided into parts with each part paid for once it’s done). N.B. Our budget for the current job is around USD 800.00 - 1,500. A successful candidate could be engaged long-term to add more features later and also work on other web development projects. less","Woocommerce, Django, Drupal, Website Development",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Togo",NA,NA,NA

Your report needs to be structured as follow: 1. Purpose In this section, the purpose of the report needs to be clearly and concisely stated. 2. Background In this section, a brief literature review on the association between life satisfaction and GDP is required. Why are economists interested in this particular issue? 3. Method In this section, the data source and empirical approach used to examine the relationship between life satisfaction and GDP needs to be detailed. 4. Results In this section, you need to present and summarize the results from your statistical analysis. In particular, the results section must: -Provide a descriptive analysis of the two variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum). Which countries have the lowest and average life satisfaction scores? Which countries have the lowest and highest GDPs per capita? -Develop a scatter diagram with GDP per capita as the independent variable. What does the scatter diagram indicate about the relationship between the two variables? -Develop and estimate a regression equation that can be used to predict average life satisfaction given GDP per capita. -State the estimated regression equation and interpret the meaning of the slope coefficient (to make the interpretation easier multiply the estimated coefficient by 10,000). -Is there a statistically significant association between GDP per capita and average life satisfaction? What is your conclusion? -Did the regression equation provide a good fit? Explain. -Luxembourg, Ireland, and Norway appear to be outliers in terms of GDP per capita. Reestimate your regression model without Luxembourg, Ireland, and Norway. How does this affect the slope coefficient and goodness of fit? Explain. 5. Discussion In this section, provide a brief overview of the results. What are the key strengths and limitations of this analysis? (e.g., data, method, etc.). How do the results from this analysis compare with other studies? (e.g., are the findings consistent?). Do these findings have clear policy implications? 6. Recommendations In this section, you should present three to five well-considered recommendations. Please ensure that your report is submitted as a single file.
