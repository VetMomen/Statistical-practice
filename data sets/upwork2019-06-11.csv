(Wordpress/frontend/backend)","https://www.upwork.com/job/Website-App-developer-required-build-website-from-our-designs-Wordpress-frontend-backend_~0157fd2c6392eff548/","Intermediate",NA,"2019-06-10","Brief We are creating a website for user populated sports leagues (similar to fantasy football). The website will allow users to sign up and create their own interactive sporting league that will allow them and all their friends who join the league to input their statistics when they complete a round regarldess of where in the world they are. Each player can add their own scores and stats and then complete with others around the world in their league. Further details: The structure: Pages 1. Sign in/Sign up (this will be the homepage, so it's very simple) 2. Profile page (profile info, join and create a league). You will also be able to see all the leagues you are in. As you could be in multiple leagues. 3. League page. (something like this - http://alchemists-wp.dan-fisher.com/soccer/team/alchemists/) 4. Billing & payment page. 5. Page about player. What should be included on the league page? - A league table - Past Winners - Although this will be blank to begin with - Various Stats - any that we could include . E.g. player average score, best round, worst round. - Player Updates/Log - as someone enters a score it says ""John Deer has just scored 36 points at..."" (this on the right-hand side of the example page and I assume is built into the plugin) As we allow people to enter more stats we can increase the stats that are shown but to begin with I think that's all that's needed. Users must be able to easily add their scores and the leagues automatically updates. Personalisation of the league - Option to specify how many rounds for that league. This can be a fixed number of rounds each, or it can be time-based until a certain date where the best 10 scores are counted etc. Inclusion of Major Events - not essential but if we could do this would be great. The league organise can set certain dates as a ‘major’. One round you get an extra point for these rounds... adds a bit of pressure. Also if they have actual in person competitions - like a big tournament, I would like them to able to add the winner to the stats. It would also be good to be able to arrange these in person tournaments via the page. less","Website, WordPress, Web Apps, Wordpress Website",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","United Kingdom",NA,NA,NA

It is a good idea to use open source libraries such as PJSIP 1) SIP softphone connects to the Cloud server API (HTTPS) to get the registration settings: SIP login/pass, SIP server address/port/protocol. The cloud server will be developed by another team 2) SIP softphone is registered on the SIP server with the login/pass provided from the cloud server 3) SIP softphone receives task data from a cloud server (using Cloud server API). The task contains information about how often and to which number to make a call 4) SIP softphone makes calls according to the received task, send/receive RTP (softphone can play some test audio file) and collects all possible statistics about the call: call date and time, calling and called numbers, duration, and RTP stats: jitter, packet loss and calculate MOS. All collected statistics posts to the Cloud server 5) SIP softphone should be able to answer an incoming call. This need for the scenario when both SIP softphone clients registered on the same PBX Server and able to call each other Cloud Server will be developed by another team. This will be a VoIP monitoring system to collect and show information about the quality of the calls thru some PBX servers. less","Standalone Application, Linux, SIP, VOIP Software",NA,"$0 ","No feedback yet","Kyrgyzstan",NA,NA,NA

The tool would use Google Play, App Store and/or App Annie data results to determine the most popular apps, generate this sample as a list, and collect various data automatically about these apps or games. Data includes information that can be automatically collected (e.g. target age, tags, app description, cost, and anything else that can be gathered) and also manually determined tags.

We will manually update the cells for each person by time block. -We would like the ability to add a toggle to only show certain names or blocks of time. For example, if we wanted to only look at Alanna, Caroline and Tony for the 6:00, 7:00 and 8:00 time blocks and hide all the other cells. But, we want a simple check box that would hide the other cells we don't want to see (other names or time blocks). So we would only keep a check mark next to the times and names we want visible. -The employee names on the top row of the sheet will be edited (names added and names removed) on a monthly basis, so the script would need to account for that. -The scheduled appointments will change on a weekly basis - recurring appointments added or removed. See attached sample sheet. Names are at the top and if you scroll all the way to the right, there are sample fields that show as the control panel. If this is something you are able to do, please let me know as well as the amount of time it would take to create the script once we have the final sheet.
