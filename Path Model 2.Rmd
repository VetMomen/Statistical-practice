This Model From *Latent Variable Modeling Using R* Book 
For Any Advice feel free to contact me at : vet.m.mohamed@gmail.com

The following Image is the Model which we are going to work on 

![](D:\Data Science\STATS TUTORIAL & PRACTICE\statstools\SEM\Path2.png)

First of all we have to load all libraries which might be useful 

```{r lib}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)
library(knitr)

```
Now lets save the correlation matrix and preparing it for analysis 

```{r cor}
corr<-c(1.000,				
        0.178,	1.000,			
        0.230,	0.327,	1.000,		
        0.106,	0.245,	0.183,	1.000,	
        0.195,	0.356,	0.721,	0.178,	1.000)

#convering it to complete matrix 

corr<-lav_matrix_lower2full(corr)

rownames(corr)<-colnames(corr)<-c("R","SES","CA","ST","AC")

print(corr)
```

Now is the time for our model specification :

```{r mod1}
model<-"
AC~ST+CA+SES+R
ST~CA+SES+R
CA~SES+R
SES~R

CA~~1*CA
AC~~AC
ST~~1*ST
"
```

After Specifying the model lets run it in cfa() function

```{r mod run}
fit<-cfa(model = model,sample.cov = corr,sample.nobs = 18058)

#lets look at the model coef.

summary(fit,standardized = T)

```

as we see here that all coefficient are significant and it is standerdaized as we built the model on correlation matrix 

some loadings are high and some are low but all of these are significant 

lets look at the fit measures 

```{r fit }
fitmeasures(fit,fit.measures = c("chisq","df","cfi","tli","rmsea","rmsea.ci.upper","rmsea.ci.lower"))
```

though the model is just identified due to 0 df but CFI and TLI and even RMSEA is perfect 

```{r plotting}
semPaths(object = fit,whatLabels = "par",layout = "spring")
```
